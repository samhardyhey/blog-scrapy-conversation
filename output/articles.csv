            Politics with Michelle Grattan: Professor Joseph Ibrahim on COVID in aged care – and the end of nursing homes
          ","Joseph Ibrahim, Professor and Head, Health Law and Ageing Research Unit, Monash University, specialises in aged care issues. He has been a long-term advocate for improving the quality of life for those in residential care and for reform of the sector.  ,In this podcast, Ibrahim says currently COVID in aged care facilities is going largely unnoticed in the media.  “If you have a look into the media coverage it would seem that it’s not a problem at all. [But] COVID deaths are far greater than at any time in the last two to three years”. While the vaccines have helped get things under control, the absence of restrictions is seeing infection rates at an all-time high. Ibrahim believes there should be a more tailored approach to outbreaks at facilities, depending on the circumstances.,A key election promise from Anthony Albanese was for a nurse on-site 24/7 in aged care facilities. Ibrahim is sceptical about how this will be achieved, given how many would be needed to meet the objective. “We would need 15,000 new nurses just to have one nurse in every facility, 24/7.”,More generally, in relation to the desperate staff shortages in the sector, Ibrahim says there is a “lack of respect” for aged care workers, citing low pay, the treatment they are given compared to healthcare professionals in hospitals, and the lesser opportunities for a career path. ,Home care packages are key to the ability of many older people to stay at home. “I don’t think we’re keeping people at home for as long as we could […] Both governments have addressed and increased the amount of support packages available. The issue with that is, the package may be available, but the staff aren’t there to deliver on what’s within that package”. In some cases “I think people want to stay at home because they’re fearful of going into residential care, and so residential care isn’t seen as an option, it’s seen as a last resort”.,More radically, Ibrahim would like to see the end of nursing homes altogether. “We shouldn’t be having nursing homes at all […] do we believe that orphanages are a good way to look after children who have fractured family or who don’t have parents?”,One alternative to nursing homes would be “you might have small communal housing that might have five to ten people in them”. ,“Or there are design changes around what you do when you get to 60, 70 or 80 in terms of downsizing and moving into a home that is more likely to meet your needs […] There’s also shared communal housing with people of different ages and different needs.,""I think we’ve been very lazy in just relying on aged care homes as a solution. So we’ve picked a lazy solution and we’re doing it badly.”","Published: September 15, 2022 7.10pm AEST",https://theconversation.com/politics-with-michelle-grattan-professor-joseph-ibrahim-on-covid-in-aged-care-and-the-end-of-nursing-homes-190753,"<li class=""topic-list-item"">

            Media coverage of Queen Elizabeth’s death began well, but quickly descended into farce
          ","In Australia, as in Britain and the United States, professional mass media are part of the Establishment. This status even has its own name: the fourth estate. So at times like the death of Queen Elizabeth II, the pressure to conform to political and social expectations is intense.,Those expectations include treating such a story as being of overwhelming importance, and preferring to promote unity over divisiveness, respectfulness over criticism, the status quo over radical change, politesse over frankness, and sentimentality over hard-headedness.,It is a time when the fourth estate puts aside its fundamental role of holding power to account so as not to risk being pilloried for betraying those expectations.,The end result is what we have seen in abundance since Queen Elizabeth II died on September 8 2022. If it looks like a reflection of Establishment interests, that’s because it is.,But it is also, to an immeasurable but unmistakable extent, a reflection of public expectations too.,Queen Elizabeth was the only head of state any Australian not in their seventies has ever known. The esteem in which she was held has been obvious for many years simply by virtue of the accepted political wisdom that the prospect of Australians voting for a republic in her lifetime was nil.,It is only fair, then, that any critique of the coverage be set against the background of those realities.,The Australian media certainly treated this as a story of overwhelming importance. On the Friday and Saturday immediately following the Queen’s death this was amply shown by rolling television coverage, commemorative lift-outs and wraparounds in the newspapers, followed by extensive coverage on inside pages.,There is a fixed routine to covering events like this – a trunk story summarising the main news points, reaction from political leaders, tributes, stories of ordinary people’s encounters with the queen, a potted history of her reign, reminiscences of her visits to Australia. It was all there.,So was the shmaltzy tone. From the Sydney Morning Herald: her “lasting love for the harbour city” and “We did but see her passing by […]”.,However, there was also in the SMH and elsewhere clear-eyed analyses of the fragile state of the United Kingdom and the contrast between the two Elizabethan eras. In the late 16th century, England was growing into a mighty military and commercial power; the reign of Elizabeth II was a period of long-run decline.,
  ,
,A striking aspect of the television coverage was that on the Friday night, Seven’s and Nine’s news bulletins heavily outrated the ABC’s. OzTAM TV ratings, from Australia’s five biggest cities, showed Seven News attracting 852,000 viewers, Nine News 736,000 and the ABC’s Queen Elizabeth II (1926-2022), only 201,000.,Even allowing for the fact the commercial bulletins usually out-rate the ABC’s, on a story like this it might be expected that the national broadcaster would at least close the gap.,However, over the weekend none of the networks’ news specials attracted many viewers. Seven’s coverage of the proclamation of Charles III attracted 279,000, its tribute to the Queen 136,000, and the ABC’s continuing coverage 206,000.,There is a lesson here. Public expectations about how stories of overwhelming importance are covered have clearly shifted. Rolling television coverage now loses impetus swiftly unless there is new material continuously replenishing it, as with the September 11 attacks on the US or bushfire emergencies. The same lesson probably applies to the print media also.,The steam had started to go out of the royal story by Saturday evening. The death of the Queen and the proclamation of the King had been done.,By Sunday, the only development was the start of the journey bringing the Queen’s body from Balmoral Castle to London.,
  ,
,Yet the ABC’s 7pm bulletin stuck with this for 24 minutes, nearly all of it rehashed from the previous day, and on Monday the newspapers were still giving over six or more forward news pages to it.,The coverage has just got more bizarre and banal by the day: clouds containing visions of the queen’s head or the queen on a horse; the new king losing his temper over a leaky fountain pen; a little girl who dresses up like the queen when she rides her horse; another little girl cuddling a corgi.,Meanwhile, in Ukraine there has been a decisive thrust by Ukrainian forces, which has pushed the Russians out of a substantial part of the Donbas region.,There comes a point at which editors and news directors need to recognise that expectations about the big story have been met. That point was reached by Saturday evening. Then was the time to cut back hard and wait for the funeral.,The fact that thousands of dollars have been spent sending teams to London doesn’t justify clogging up the news with non-stories.","Published: September 15, 2022 6.03am AEST",https://theconversation.com/media-coverage-of-queen-elizabeths-death-began-well-but-quickly-descended-into-farce-190645,"<li class=""topic-list-item"">

            What are uterus transplants? Who donates their uterus? And what are the risks?
          ","The opportunity to conceive, carry and give birth to a biologically related child is a deep desire for many women and their partners. Since the introduction of ,, many people in countries such as Australia have accessed support and resources to help realise their reproductive goals.,For some women, the lack of a functioning uterus has kept that opportunity out of reach. This includes those with a congenital condition such as , syndrome, and those who had a hysterectomy for medical reasons. ,For these women, the only options for parenthood have been surrogacy or adoption. Access to both is often difficult.,Uterus transplants are changing that. From next year, uterus transplants are being trialled in Australia. However, there are risks involved and ethical concerns which must be addressed before it can become mainstream clinical treatment.,Uterus transplantation is a , in which a donated uterus is surgically removed from a suitable donor and transplanted into an eligible recipient. ,Hormones are used to stimulate menstruation in the recipient, and once the uterus is functioning normally, an IVF-created embryo is transferred into the woman’s uterus. ,Following successful implantation and healthy development, the baby is delivered via caesarean section. This is because a uterus transplant pregnancy is regarded as high risk, and the woman may not be able to feel contractions. Women with the congenital absence of a uterus will not be able to deliver vaginally.,
  ,
,As with all transplants, the uterus recipient is prescribed immunosuppression medication to prevent rejection of the donor organ. These drugs are administered at levels deemed safe for the developing foetus. Close monitoring continues throughout the pregnancy to ensure the safety of both woman and foetus.,Immunosuppression continues until the delivery of up to two healthy babies or five years after the transplant, whichever is first. ,The uterus is then surgically removed via hysterectomy, enabling immunosuppression – which carries risks and side-effects – to be ceased. Risks from immunosuppression include infection, reduced blood cell count, heart disease and suppression of bone marrow growth. And these risks increase with time.,Uterus transplantation is an “ephemeral” transplant: a non-life-saving temporary transplant, aimed solely at enabling reproduction. These features make it medically and ethically distinct from other transplants.,Scientists started developing uterus transplantation in animals in the 1970s. The first attempts in humans occurred in , and ,, both of which failed.  ,After 14 years of research, Professor Mats Brannstrom and his team at Sweden’s Sahlgrenska University Hospital started the world’s first human trials in 2013. In 2014, the ,.,With more than 25 countries now performing or planning uterus transplants, it is estimated that , have been performed, resulting in more than 40 healthy live births. While not all transplants are successful, the live birth rate from a uterus that is functioning successfully after transplantation is ,. ,In Australia, , have been approved and plan to start within the next 12-18 months.,Most uterus transplants so far have used altruistic living donors, typically a mother donating to her daughter or an aunt to her niece.,But cases using uteruses from deceased donors have also been successful, with ,. ,Uteruses from deceased donors are mostly provided through standard family consent methods for medical research. But in future they could be provided through organ donor registration processes modified to include the uterus. ,Currently, only pre-menopausal women can be uterus donors, and living donors need to have had a successful pregnancy to be eligible to donate. But this , to be a requirement for deceased donors, potentially enabling younger donors and increasing the availability of uteruses for transplantation.  ,Of the two approved Australian trials, only one (led by Royal Hospital for Women, for which I provide independent ethical advice) will conduct both living and deceased donor uterus transplantation. The other (through Royal Prince Alfred hospital) will trial only living donor transplantation.,Participation in these uterus transplant trials will remain limited while uterus transplantation is still in the research phase, and will depend on the availability of funding.,For recipients, the main surgical risks are organ rejection, infection, and blood clots or thrombosis, as well as risks arising from the surgery duration (average 5 hours) such as blood clots (including in the lung) and from immunosuppression. ,While challenging, ,  through close monitoring and early intervention using blood thinners and encouraging recipients to move around soon after surgery.,For living donors, physical risks arise from surgery duration (6-11 hours) and operative and postoperative complications, the most common being urinary tract injury and infection.,There are also ethical and psychological risks. These include the possibility of a potential donor feeling pressured to donate to a family member, and experiencing guilt and failure if the transplant is not successful or results in adverse outcomes. ,These risks may be reduced with appropriate counselling and support. But as with all altruistic organ donation, they cannot be entirely eliminated.,Deceased donor transplantation also carries risks but involves less surgical time than living donor transplantation (typically 1-2 hours) and therefore less demand on medical resources and personnel.,Deceased donor transplantation may be less ethically fraught. There is no prospect of pressure, guilt or surgical risk to the deceased donor, who must have been declared brain dead and be suitable for multi-organ donation. Their organs may only be procured with proper consent, following the usual protocols and procedures.,
  ,
,In Australia, as elsewhere, organ donors are in short supply. But deceased donors might be found via existing donation registries and consent processes, such as those managed by , and ,.  ,It’s important to be able to compare the outcomes of living and deceased donation in similar recipients and contexts. This will inform future guidelines and policies around uterus donation, and determine whether it can become mainstream clinical practice. ,Emerging evidence suggests ,. Using deceased donor organs allows longer veins and arteries to be retrieved, enabling better blood flow for the uterus and potentially greater success in transplants and pregnancies.,So although there are currently fewer cases of deceased donors, there are sound medical and ethical reasons for Australian uterus transplant research with both deceased and living donors.","Published: September 16, 2022 6.03am AEST",https://theconversation.com/what-are-uterus-transplants-who-donates-their-uterus-and-what-are-the-risks-190443,"<li class=""topic-list-item"">

            Nearly 30% of Australia’s emissions come from industry. Tougher rules for big polluters is a ","Australia’s historic climate law passed the Senate last week and enshrined an economy-wide target to reduce emissions. But an important measure to reduce Australia’s industrial emissions is still up for debate: the “safeguard mechanism”.,Introduced by the Abbott government in 2014, the safeguard mechanism is supposed to stop Australia’s largest greenhouse gas polluters from emitting over a certain threshold. But the policy has been frequently , for lacking teeth. The Labor government has promised to strengthen the mechanism, and is currently ,.,Industry has , over any toughening of the policy. Meanwhile, the Greens , Labor to strengthen it further.,The safeguard mechanism covers the grid-connected power stations with a sectoral target. It also , of Australia’s largest industrial emitters. Together, these 215 facilities produce almost 30% of Australia’s total annual emissions. So a stringent policy to curb this pollution is crucial to climate action.,The safeguard mechanism works by setting a limit on the emissions individual enterprises can produce in a year. This limit is put into place with “baselines” that get set in a number of different ways, depending on the type of company involved. Such companies might include a mining company, aluminium smelter, steelworks or airline.  ,If the company emits beyond their limit, they can buy carbon credits to compensate for, or “offset”, the excess emissions.,The mechanism covers hard-to-abate industries which are regulated on an individual basis, such as new ,, steel, aluminium, manufacturing and transport. These include Woodside’s Northwest Shelf gas project, Qantas, Chevron’s Gorgon gas project, Port Kembla steelworks, and AngloAmerican coal mines in central Queensland.,Coal fired power remains our biggest ,, but is regulated separately. A “,” has been set for all electricity generators connected to the national grid at 198 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalent each year. ,Historically, the safeguard mechanism hasn’t put strong obligations on industrial emitters to reduce their emissions. Indeed, industrial emissions , since the mechanism began in 2016.,Imposing a genuine carbon limit on high-emitting companies requires a clear definition and enforcement of the baselines. But the safeguard mechanism provides enormous scope for expanded production and, therefore, expanded emissions.,The government’s , identifies a major problem with how baselines have been set in the past. Namely, many facilities have been allowed to set their baseline emissions well above their actual emissions. ,
  ,
,Baselines for each facilities’ emissions are currently measured according to “production-adjusted” emissions intensity. So, for example, a coal mine’s baseline is measured per tonne of coal commodity produced. This means over time, baselines rise or fall in proportion to a company’s expected production. ,The government’s , reports that in the 2020-21 financial year the combined baseline emissions recorded for non-electricity grid emissions under the safeguard mechanism was estimated at 180 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalent. ,But , emissions in the same period were 137 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalent. ,It should also be noted that , suggests up to one in five fossil fuel projects are underestimating their actual emissions. But regardless, the high baselines mean there’s no regulatory pressure for companies to reduce their emissions.,The current review paper seeks feedback on these issues. Removing the head room for facilities with baselines well above their actual emissions is on the cards. ,The government , to propose significantly expanding carbon credit trading under the safeguard mechanism.,Carbon credits are granted to projects that reduce, store or avoid greenhouse gas emissions. These credits can be sold to the federal government or to private companies to offset a project’s own emissions. ,Under the current safeguard mechanism, if a company exceeds its baseline emissions, then it can purchase Australian carbon credits to offset this.,These carbon offsets, however, are plagued with credibility problems. In fact, another federal government , to examine the issues. ,
  ,
,There are calls to strongly limit or remove questionable offsets linked to the safeguard mechanism.,For instance, climate science professor Mark Howden , that offsets should not be used to give big emitters a “free ride” to continue polluting if they invest in carbon sequestration projects, at this stage. 
Instead, the immediate priorities should be limiting fossil fuel combustion burning, and making concrete plans for other industries to transition.,Despite this, the federal government is considering expanding trade in these and potentially other types of carbon credits. ,The government , a new type of carbon credit for companies emitting below their baseline. For instance, if an aluminium smelter reduced its emissions over 2024 and 2025, it could be granted credits to sell to others in the carbon market. ,The government is also considering , to trade carbon credits on an international level, pending reforms to address integrity issues in safeguard mechanism like the baseline headroom problem. ,
  ,
,The international trade in carbon credits has been plagued with problems for 20 years. A , found little evidence demonstrating causal effect of carbon trading markets on emissions reduction. ,It puts a strong case forward , internationally, after Europe, Quebec and California case studies show linking carbon markets has led to price crashes and volatility – not stability.,We can expect industry to continue to lobby for a weak safeguard mechanism and carbon credit rules. But if the Labor government is genuine about wanting to reduce Australia’s emissions, our biggest polluters cannot be allowed to carry on emitting as usual.,And there is no role for a carbon trading policy that excuses big emitters from making clean energy transition plans.,Labor , the numerous pro-climate independent senators or the Greens to make changes signalled in the safeguard consultation paper. They are unlikely to be satisfied with a weak carbon trading scheme. ,Any proposed changes that undermine Australia’s emissions reduction goals will not easily be passed.","Published: September 16, 2022 6.03am AEST",https://theconversation.com/nearly-30-of-australias-emissions-come-from-industry-tougher-rules-for-big-polluters-is-a-no-brainer-190264,"<li class=""topic-list-item"">

            M*A*S*H, 50 years on: the ","MASH, stylised as M*A*S*H, is the story of a rag-tag bunch of medical misfits of the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital thrown together against the horrors of the Korean war in the 1950s. The series endured for 11 seasons, from September 1972 to the final episode in 1983. ,Originally it was centred on two army surgeons, the wisecracking but empathetic Benjamin “Hawkeye” Pierce, played by Alan Alda, and the deadpan “Trapper” John McIntyre, played by Wayne Rogers.,The show had an ensemble cast and different episodes would often focus on one of the featured characters. ,There was the meek Corporal “Radar” O'Reilly, cross-dressing Corporal Klinger, the easy-going Lieutenant Colonel Henry Blake and pious Father Mulcahy. The antagonists, conniving Major Frank Burns and Major Margaret “Hot Lips” Houlihan, were foils for Hawkeye and Trapper but occasionally were central characters in some episodes too.,Based on the 1970 movie, itself based on a novel, MASH was designed as a “black comedy” set during the Korean War. ,It was really a thinly veiled critique of the war in Vietnam raging at the time. ,The creators of the show knew they wouldn’t get away with making a Vietnam war comedy. Uncensored news broadcasts showing the viciousness of Vietnam were transmitted straight to the American public who were, by now, growing jaded of the increasingly brutal war.,Setting the series 20 years earlier allowed the creators to mask their criticisms behind a historical perspective – but most viewers realised the true context.,
  ,
,What started as a criticism of the Vietnam war soon evolved into one for all wars. ,In many episodes, audiences would be reminded of the horrors of lives lost in the fighting on the line, and the angst and trauma faced by those behind the line. ,It didn’t matter which war this was, MASH was saying all wars are the same, full of shattered lives.,Cloaking this message in comedy was the way the creators were able to make it palatable to a wide audience. ,The early seasons have a distinctive sitcom feel to them, mostly as a result of the series co-creators, Larry Gelbart and Gene Reynolds, who were from a comedy background. ,When both creatives left by the end of season five the show took a more dramatic turn.,In particular, Alda became more involved in the writing and took it into a more dramatic direction, toning down the comedic elements. This was also reflected in the change of many of the secondary characters. ,The philandering, practical joker Trapper was replaced by the moral and professional BJ Hunnicutt, the snivelling Frank Burns by the pretentious Charles Winchester, the laconic Henry Blake with the officious Sherman Potter, and the complete absence of Radar after season eight. The voice of the series took on a noticeably Hawkeye focus.,As the Vietnam war ended in 1975, the tone of the show also changed. It became less political and focused more on the dilemmas of the individual characters. The laugh track was toned down. But this did not make the show any less popular. ,Audiences responded strongly to the anarchic anti-authoritarianism of Hawkeye and Trapper/BJ. ,Almost all the characters are anti-war, reflecting the growing antagonism the American public was feeling towards the Vietnam war and war fatigue in general, post-Vietnam. ,Even Frank and Hot Lips, the most patriotic characters, sometimes questioned if the war was worth all the suffering and death. And the series reminded people the humour used was not meant to disrespect those fighting but as a coping mechanism of the trauma by those involved.,
  ,
,That’s not to say there aren’t issues with the show when looked at with modern sensibilities. ,Contemporary audiences would find problems with some of the representations of characters and issues addressed in the series. Corporal Klinger would today be seen as contentious. His penchant for dressing in women’s clothes was not because he was trans or interested in drag, but because he was trying to get a “Section 8”, or mental health, discharge. ,Many of the female characters were also relegated to little more than two-dimensional romantic interests or background characters. ,The only woman who starred with a significant recurring role was “Hot Lips” Houlihan but, as the nickname implies, she was often the butt of sexualised humour. ,This has not stopped the show maintaining its popularity in the continual re-runs it gets on cable and streaming services. ,MASH was a product of its time, yet its themes on the absurdity of war are universal. It became more than a TV show: a shared cathartic experience for war-weary audiences. ,At its heart is the eclectic mix of dysfunctional characters who use humour to laugh in the face of adversity. This is what makes MASH a timeless classic.","Published: September 16, 2022 6.03am AEST",https://theconversation.com/m-a-s-h-50-years-on-the-anti-war-sitcom-was-a-product-of-its-time-yet-its-themes-are-timeless-190422,"<li class=""topic-list-item"">

            New Zealand has announced a biofuel mandate to cut transport emissions, but that could be the worst option for the climate
          ","Biofuels – and a broader bioeconomy – are key parts of New Zealand’s recently released first ,, particularly for transport, forestry and a transition to a more circular use of resources.,Work is moving fast, with a biofuel mandate for land transport to be , from April 2023 and a plan to transform the forestry industry currently under ,.,A bioeconomy is heralded as an opportunity to replace imported fossil fuels with carbon-neutral domestic biofuels and to create higher-value products from plantation forestry (much of which is currently exported as unprocessed logs) while supporting carbon sequestration at the same time.,New Zealand is not the only country thinking along these lines. Biofuels are part of a widespread strategy to address emissions from existing fossil-fueled vehicles, tens of millions of which are still being produced annually. They are also promoted for planes, ships and heavy trucks, often with few alternatives. ,Both the ,, a landmark US law which aims to curb inflation by investing in domestic clean energy production, and the EU’s ,, , for biofuels through a combination of subsidies and mandates. In the International Energy Agency (,)’s , scenario, global biofuel production quadruples by 2050, to supply 14% of transport energy.,Unfortunately, a , of , ,, combined with experience of the real-world impacts of biofuels thus far, point to several downsides and challenges, both economic and environmental.,
  ,
,The risks of first-generation biofuels, made from crops grown on arable land, are well known. They are not due to the fuels themselves or their production, but their indirect effects of how the land would have been used otherwise.,Already, , is used for biofuels. This is at the heart of the “food-to-fuel” issue. This approach has been challenged because it could increase grain prices or, at the worst, lead to starvation. It has also led to agricultural expansion, often into ecologically sensitive areas. ,Debated for years, it is now back in the spotlight as the effects of droughts in China, the US and Europe, combined with the war in Ukraine, push food prices up , on 2019-2020 levels.,
  ,
,Palm oil has borne the brunt of criticism about landuse change, as vast areas of rainforest in Indonesia and Malaysia have been cleared for its production. The impact of such “induced landuse change” (,) gives palm oil biofuel nearly , the emissions of fossil fuel. ,But palm oil is a substitute for many other vegetable oils. Therefore, biofuel production from other oils like rapeseed (canola) is also implicated in ILUC, as diverting rapeseed to fuel leads to more palm oil entering the food chain.,The EU has undergone a , of strengthening the standards of its biofuel mandate. In the end, palm oil was the only feedstock listed as “high ILUC”, but was given a reprieve until 2030.,The cheapest biofuels with the biggest emissions savings are made from used cooking oil and beef tallow. But these feedstocks are in , and open to ,. They also already have other uses, which again raises the issue of substitution. ,Z Energy’s NZ$50m tallow biodiesel plant, opened in 2018, has been mothballed due to the rising cost of tallow. The company has , on plans for a much larger plant.,Since New Zealand’s biofuel mandate will initially be met solely by imports, questions of sustainability and certifiability of feedstocks will be crucial. It is concerning that landuse change will , when calculating emissions reductions.,The fuels will count as zero-emission in New Zealand, while the actual emissions from growing, fertilising, processing and transporting will take place overseas, likely in countries with weaker climate targets. Unless accounted for, this is carbon leakage by design.,For all these reasons, proponents are keen to talk up the prospect of second-generation biofuels, made from non-food crops. In New Zealand’s case, the main crop is pine trees. ,Although there is some forestry waste available, much of it is currently left on site and would be expensive to collect and transport. The , report, commissioned by the government, focuses on logs-to-fuel, specifically “drop-in” fuels that can substitute directly for petrol, diesel or jet fuel.,However, there are , in commercial operation anywhere. The report calls the risks of such an unproved technology extreme, with little prospect for mitigation. ,
  ,
,The economics are also challenging, in part because log prices are high due to the efficiency of the log export market. A plant capable of producing 150 million litres of drop-in fuels a year – just 1.5% of New Zealand’s liquid fuel demand – would cost $1.2 billion and have a negative rate of return. ,To obtain an acceptable return, the government would need to pay for half the cost of the plant and the logs, and also subsidise (or enforce) a 50% higher sale price of the fuel. The report envisages such a plant being completed by 2028 in New Zealand.,A fundamental obstacle is that any such use has to compete with other uses – including sawn timber, wood chips and wood pellets – which are far simpler, more profitable and come with greater carbon benefits.,For all these reasons, we have formed the interest group ,, which aims to stop New Zealand’s biofuel mandate.,As advocates of strong climate action, these are painful conclusions to reach. But we argue that for transport, the answer lies in the , framework, which encourages people to drive less, shift necessary trips to other modes and make them less polluting. ,Biofuels only enter in the third and least important step (improve) and even there, they are the worst option. ,The transport transformations envisaged in the new climate plans for , and , are heavily focused on avoidance and shifts to other modes. These options should be the priority.","Published: September 16, 2022 6.03am AEST",https://theconversation.com/new-zealand-has-announced-a-biofuel-mandate-to-cut-transport-emissions-but-that-could-be-the-worst-option-for-the-climate-189960,"<li class=""topic-list-item"">

            Somalia on the brink of famine: aid efforts risk failing marginalised communities yet again
          ","Somalia is facing a , of enormous severity and magnitude. This follows four failed rainy seasons, protracted conflict, political instability and the impact of rising global food prices – the latter made significantly worse by the war in Ukraine and the disruption to global food and fuel markets. ,There’s a strong possibility of famine being declared later this year and this dire situation is predicted to continue well into next year. ,Up to , are considered in need of urgent humanitarian assistance. That’s nearly half of Somalia’s population. The last two famines in Somalia saw roughly 250,000 people die in each. The people that die , marginalised and minority groups in the country. Experts are worried that the death toll this time could meet or even exceed this level. ,I’ve studied and highlighted many of the issues with the humanitarian response in Somalia. Judging by discussions I’ve had with experts and observers close to the ground I’m dismayed that, once again, not enough aid is reaching marginalised and minority people within the country, by either Government or aid agencies. , that I’ve put together with colleagues – a mix of academic and humanitarian experts – we reveal that many of the problems that our research team , remain today. ,In particular, the humanitarian community’s failure to help the most vulnerable groups in southern Somalia , challenge. These groups – who are marginalised because of Somalia’s social hierarchies – , of mortality in the 1991-1992 and 2011 famines. ,Since late last year, in anticipation of a potential famine, my colleagues and I have lobbied humanitarian donors and agencies to , on their exclusion from aid resources. This has taken place through presentations and direct advisories with these agencies. ,Many individuals within the “system” are genuinely motivated to find solutions in order to ensure that aid is much more equitably distributed. But the humanitarian sector mirrors broader structural inequalities and power dynamics in Somalia. This reflects vested interests and an acceptance of the status quo in many quarters. It’s a stagnation that must be addressed. ,The implications of this situation are that, ultimately, the humanitarian community means little, and brings few benefits, to many groups that it claims to represent and assist – the “most vulnerable”. ,All societies have their marginalised and minority groups. These populations typically reflect ethnic or religious identities, racial or caste groups. ,Somalia is no different in this respect. It has its own societal hierarchy. There are four main clan families in the country – the Dir, Hawiye, Darod and the Digil and Mirifle. ,The Digil and Mirifle are a historically marginalised clan family. The Somali Bantu, are a large minority group, who are not part of the clan system at all. ,These two groups are mainly found in the south of the country and are not small minorities. Together they may constitute over 40% of the entire population of Somalia. They comprised the majority of famine victims in both the 1991-1992 and the 2011 famines. They also make up the , of the internally displaced population.,In the latest warnings of famine, the geographic areas , are exactly those that have seen famine previously. And a recent , found that they have not been sufficiently consulted or reached in emergency assessments. Because of this, we believe that many will not be receiving the cash, food, medical and other interventions they are entitled to. ,These marginalised groups are already highly vulnerable to food insecurity and famine because of their structural position in society – they are largely rural , on education and international migration. This has limited their members from obtaining formal employment (including with government and aid organisations), the creation of business communities and the establishment of significant diaspora populations. ,This is crucial, as , showed. Families and clans that had members (close or distant) in urban employment, as part of a business community or in the ,, were able to call on crucial support through their social networks.,This issue of marginalisation and minority exclusion from aid resources has been a regular topic of conversation in humanitarian circles since at least 2014. This followed the release of ,, including ours. However, the humanitarian sector in Somalia as a whole has failed to turn these words into significant actions and organisational change. ,We’ve seen how, in some instances, humanitarian resources and actors empower certain groups over others. For instance, we found that there are few employees or credible NGOs and institutions from these two groups – the Somali Bantu and the Digil and Mirifle – and where they exist they are likely to be discriminated against in job and resource opportunities. This maintains, or exacerbates, structural inequalities. ,Discord, competition and a lack of leadership , the humanitarian sector. It’s beset by a high turnover of staff and, because it’s also so dependent on individuals, struggles to learn from past experience. This makes it hard to develop and maintain an understanding of complex issues and their solutions. ,The humanitarian system is currently scaling up – albeit late – in recognition of the scale and severity of the situation, however the incentives inherent in the humanitarian response lean towards scale rather than severity. This means that the easiest people to reach are likely to be prioritised rather than those most at risk of death; it is not easy to reach many of the groups we are most concerned by, whether in camps for internally displaced people or in remote areas under al-Shabaab influence. ,There are a number of changes that could address this issue.,Agencies must develop a more strategic approach – and make the organisational changes needed – so that exclusion is addressed as a priority both internally as well as in relation to those they work with. An immediate step that could yield positive results would be to seek out these groups. However, the reality is that these problems are so deeply entrenched it will take years to overcome. ,Next, there must be comprehensive research on and with these groups to better understand their predicament and get their input on how to include them in aid practices. Bringing legitimate representatives of these groups into humanitarian circles and discussions will give them a greater voice at the table. ,Understanding local power dynamics, including majority-minority tensions, let alone resisting them is not easy but it is incumbent on agencies to invest in doing this better.,Without concerted efforts in this direction the humanitarian sector will continue to neglect and miss its own claimed priority populations.","Published: September 15, 2022 11.38pm AEST",https://theconversation.com/somalia-on-the-brink-of-famine-aid-efforts-risk-failing-marginalised-communities-yet-again-190174,"<li class=""topic-list-item"">

            A huge LinkedIn study just showed which connections are better when searching for a job
          ","Say you are looking for a new job. You head to LinkedIn to spruce up your profile and look around your social network. ,But who should you reach out to for an introduction to a potential new employer? A , of more than 20 million people, published in Science, shows that your close friends (on LinkedIn) are not your best bet: instead you should look to acquaintances you don’t know well enough to share a personal connection with.,In 1973, the American sociologist , coined the phrase “,” in the context of social networks. He argued that the stronger the ties between two individuals, the more their friendship networks will overlap.,Simply put, you are most likely to know all the friends of a close friend, but few of the friends of an acquaintance. ,So if you are searching for a job, you probably already know everything your immediate neighbourhood has to offer. Intuitively, it is the weak ties – your acquaintances – that offer the most opportunities for new discoveries.,Granovetter’s theory feels right, but is it? A team of researchers from LinkedIn, Harvard Business School, Stanford and MIT set out to gather some empirical evidence on how weak ties affect job mobility.,Their research piggy-backed on the efforts of engineers at LinkedIn to test and improve the platform’s “People You May Know” recommendation algorithm. LinkedIn regularly updates this algorithm, which recommends new people to add to your network.,One of these updates tested the effects of encouraging the formation of strong ties (recommending adding your close friends) versus weak ties (recommending acquaintances and friends of friends). The researchers then followed the users that participated in this “A/B testing” to see if the difference impacted their employment outcomes.,More than 20 million LinkedIn users worldwide were randomly assigned to well-defined treatment groups. Users in each group were shown slightly different new contact recommendations, which led users in some groups to form more strong ties and users in other groups to form more weak ties.,Next, the team measured how many jobs users in each group applied for, and how many “job transmissions” occurred. Job transmissions are of particular interest, as they are defined as getting a job in the same company as the new contact. A job transmission suggests the new contact helped land the job.,The study uses causal analysis to go beyond simple correlations and connect link formation with employment. There are three important findings. ,First, the recommender engine significantly shapes link formation. Users who were recommended more weak links formed significantly more weak links, and users who were recommended more strong links formed more strong links. ,Second, the experiment provides causal evidence that moderately weak ties are more than twice as effective as strong ties in helping a job-seeker join a new employer. What’s a “moderately” weak tie? The study found job transmission is most likely from acquaintances with whom you share about 10 mutual friends and rarely interact. ,Third, the strength of weak ties varied by industry. Whereas weak ties increased job mobility in more digital industries, strong ties increased job mobility in less digital industries.,This LinkedIn study is first to causally prove Granovetter’s theory in the employment market. The causal analysis is key here, as large-scale studies of correlations between strength of ties and job transmission have shown strong ties are more beneficial, in what was considered until now a paradox. ,This study resolves the paradox and again proves the limitations of correlation studies, which do a poor job at disentangling confounding factors and sometimes lead to the wrong conclusions.,From a practical point of view, the study outlines the best parameters for suggesting new links. It revealed that the connections most helpful in landing a job are your acquaintances, people you meet in professional settings, or friends of friends, rather than your closest friends – people with whom you share about 10 mutual contacts and with whom one is less likely to interact regularly. ,These can be translated into algorithmic recommendations, which can make the recommendation engines of professional networks such as LinkedIn even more proficient at helping job-seekers land jobs.,The public is often wary when large social media companies perform experiments on their users (see ,). ,So, could LinkedIn’s experiment have harmed its users? In theory, the users in the “strong link” treatment group might have missed the weak links that could have brought their next job. ,However, all groups had some degree of job mobility – some just a bit more than others. Moreover, since the researchers were observing an engineering experiment, the study itself seems to raise few ethical concerns.,Nonetheless, it is a reminder to ask how much our most intimate professional decisions – such as selecting a new career or workplace – are determined by black-box artificial intelligence algorithms whose workings we cannot see.","Published: September 16, 2022 6.04am AEST",https://theconversation.com/a-huge-linkedin-study-just-showed-which-connections-are-better-when-searching-for-a-job-190428,"<li class=""topic-list-item"">

            Keep buildings cool as it gets hotter by resurrecting traditional architectural techniques – podcast
          "," podcast is now back after a short break. Every Thursday, we explore the fascinating discoveries researchers are using to make sense of the world and the big questions they’re still trying to answer.,In this episode we find out how “modern” styles of architecture using concrete and glass have often usurped local building techniques better suited to parts of the world with hotter climates. Now some architects are resurrecting traditional techniques to help keep buildings cool.,From western Europe to ,, , and the ,, severe heatwaves brought drought, fire and death to the summer of 2022. The heatwaves also raised serious questions about the ability of existing infrastructure to cope with extreme heat, which is projected to , due to climate change. ,Yet, for thousands of years, people living in parts of the world used to high temperatures have deployed traditional passive cooling techniques in the way they designed their buildings. In Nigeria, for example, people have long used biomimicry to copy the style of local flora and fauna as they design their homes, according to Anthony Ogbuokiri, a senior lecturer in architectural design at Nottingham Trent University in the UK. ,But in the 20th century, cities even in very hot climates began following an international template for building design that meant cities around the world, regardless of where they were, often had similar looking skylines. Ogbuokiri calls this “duplitecture”, and , an in-built reliance on air conditioners. ,Alongside this, there was a massive boom in the use of concrete, particularly after the second world war when the Soviet Union and the US started gifting their cold war allies concrete technology. “It was a competition both to discover who actually mastered concrete and who was better at gathering the materials, the people and the energy to make concrete,” explains Vyta Pivo, assistant professor of architecture at the University of Michigan in the US. But too much concrete can contribute to the phenomenon of ,, where heat is concentrated in cities. Concrete is also a considerable ,. ,Some architects and researchers are working to rehabilitate and improve traditional passive techniques that help keep buildings cool without using energy.

            ‘Thinking about my future is really scary’ – school leavers are not getting the careers support they need
          ","Australia’s class of 2022 is on the home stretch. Next month, , year 12 students will be sitting their final exams. In amongst this, they are making big decisions about their lives beyond school. ,But research shows they are not getting the support they need as they finish school and move into the work or study that is right for them. Girls, in particular, are not getting the support they need. ,This suggests careers support in high school is not working. ,Careers education is not compulsory in Australian schools. There are guidelines such as the ,. And the , up to year 10 calls on schools to “develop school-based approaches to career education […] to suit the needs of their students and the community”. ,States and territories offer their own frameworks for years 11 and 12, such as Victoria’s ,.,These can be interpreted in a wide variety of ways. In reality, some schools may have dedicated careers teachers. Students sometimes seek private careers counselling. Others may have nothing. ,
  ,
,Our Monash University , published last month surveyed more than 1,300 female school students in years 10 to 12. We wanted to know about how they were choosing their careers. ,While we found more than 83% wanted to go to university, there was a significant degree of uncertainty about what next:,The also continued to nominate careers within narrow fields. Half of young women’s chosen careers were concentrated in areas such as medicine (16.7%), law and paralegal studies (12.1%), nursing (11.5%), the creative arts (9.9%) and teaching (8.2%).,These ambitions are not bad, of course. But it means these young people might be overlooking new and growing careers around digital technology or fulfilling and potentially lucrative vocational options, such as trades.,Another 2022 study , by The Smith Family surveyed over 1,500 young people and interviewed 38 students aged 17–19 experiencing disadvantage. ,While most young people surveyed (86%) recalled receiving careers support while at school, only just over half found this support helpful. One in ten said it was not useful at all.,In some cases, there was no career advice. As interviewee Rabia said:,Interviewee Mercedes said students needed advice that was individual and supportive: ,When choosing careers, interviewees said they valued hands-on work exposure, vocational study and being able to try different career options while at school. As Sahil said:,Careers advice needs to do much more than tell young people about what subjects to do in year 12 to qualify for certain degrees, or hand out pamphlets at university open days.,Apart from understanding the modern job market and current range of opportunities, careers advice needs to support young people as they move to the next stage of life. ,
  ,
,Careers support is, of course, closely related to mental health and wellbeing. More than a third of those in The Smith Family Study had a health or mental health condition which was sometimes a barrier to employment, as Tarni said:,Young people need to know they are valued and have potential, particularly in the wake of COVID disruptions last year. We need to find ways to keep them in school and provide them with better career support for their own and Australia’s future prosperity.","Published: September 16, 2022 6.04am AEST",https://theconversation.com/thinking-about-my-future-is-really-scary-school-leavers-are-not-getting-the-careers-support-they-need-190553,"<li class=""topic-list-item"">

            The peer review system is broken. We asked academics how to fix it
          ","The peer review process is a cornerstone of modern scholarship. Before new work is published in an academic journal, experts scrutinise the evidence, research and arguments to make sure they stack up.,However, many authors, reviewers and editors have , with the way the modern peer review system works. It can be slow, opaque and cliquey, and it runs on volunteer labour from already overworked academics. ,
  ,
,Last month, one of us (Kelly-Ann Allen) expressed her frustration at the difficulties of finding peer reviewers on Twitter. Hundreds of replies later, we had a huge crowd-sourced collection of criticisms of peer review and suggestions for how to make it better. ,The suggestions for journals, publishers and universities show there is plenty to be done to make peer review more accountable, fair and inclusive. We have summarised our , below. ,We see three main challenges facing the peer review system. ,First, peer review can be exploitative.,Many of the companies that publish academic journals make a profit from subscriptions and sales. However, the authors, editors and peer reviewers generally give their time and effort on a voluntary basis, effectively performing free labour.,And while peer review is often seen as a collective enterprise of the academic community, in practice a small fraction of researchers do most of the work. One study of biomedical journals found that, in 2015,  just 20% of researchers performed ,.,The second challenge is a , in the peer review process. ,Peer review is generally carried out anonymously: researchers don’t know who is reviewing their work, and reviewers don’t know whose work they are reviewing. This provides space for honesty, but can also make the process ,. ,The opacity may also suppress discussion, protect biases, and decrease the quality of the reviews.,The final challenge is the speed of peer review. ,When a researcher submits a paper to a journal, if they make it past initial ,, they may face a long wait for review and eventual publication. It is not uncommon for research to be published a year or more after submission.,This delay is bad for everyone. For policymakers, leaders and the public, it means they may be making decisions based on outdated scientific evidence. For scholars, , as they wait for the publications they need to get promotions or tenure.,
  ,
,Scholars suggest the delays are typically caused by a ,. Many academics report , can discourage them from participating in peer review, and this has become worse since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. ,It has also been found that many journals ,, limiting the size and diversity of the pool of reviewers.,So, what can be done? Most of the constructive suggestions from the large Twitter conversation mentioned earlier fell into three categories.,First, many suggested there should be better incentives for conducting peer reviews.,This might include publishers paying reviewers (the , already do this) or giving some profits to research departments. Journals could also offer reviewers free subscriptions, publication fee vouchers, or fast-track reviews. ,However, we should recognise that journals offering incentives might create new problems.,
  ,
,Another suggestion is that universities could do better in acknowledging peer review as part of the academic workload, and perhaps reward outstanding contributors to peer review. ,Some Twitter commentators argued tenured scholars should review a certain number of articles each year. Others thought more should be done to support non-profit journals, given , found some 140 journals in Australia alone ceased publishing between 2011 and 2021.,Most respondents agreed that conflicts of interest should be avoided. Some suggested databases of experts would make it easier to find relevant reviewers. ,Many respondents also suggested journals can improve how they recruit reviewers, and what work they distribute. Expert reviewers could be selected on the , expertise, and asked to focus on that element rather than both. ,Respondents also argued journals should do more to tailor their invitations to target the most relevant experts, with a simpler process to accept or reject the offer. ,Others felt that more non-tenured scholars, PhD researchers, people working in related industries, and retired experts should be recruited. More peer review training for graduate students and increased representation for women and underrepresented minorities would be a good start. ,Some repondents pointed to a growing movement towards more open peer review processes, which may create a more human and transparent approach to reviewing. For example, , publishes all decisions, review letters, and voluntary identification of peer reviewers.,Another suggestion to speed up the publishing process was to give higher priority to time-sensitive research. ,The overall message from the enormous response to a single tweet is that there is a need for systemic changes within the peer review process.,There is no shortage of ideas for how to improve the process for the benefit of scholars and the broader public. However, it will be up to journals, publishers and universities to put them into practice and create a more ,.

            Two experts break down the James Webb Space Telescope’s first images, and explain what we’ve already learnt
          ","Today we saw the release of the , taken by the James Webb Space Telescope. This is something we have both been waiting on for nearly 25 years. Back in those days, we were analysing the , of the distant universe, and the details they revealed were shocking compared to anything we’d seen in ground-based images. ,It seems the bar has been raised once again, and Webb is set to herald a new age for astronomy and space research. Its large mirror helps it produce images that are two to three times sharper than Hubble’s, and which go much deeper into space (which means it can see fainter sources). ,Webb can also see far redder infrared wavelengths, opening up a new view on the universe. This is especially important to study the early universe due to “,”, a process which refers to the stretching of light (with the expansion of the universe) as it travels across cosmic space.,It’s also useful for studying fascinating sources such as planets going around nearby stars, and the regions where stars form.,We’ve written before about the tremendous technical challenges involved in the construction of Webb and its journey into orbit. Now, with the long-awaited first images in our hands, let’s take a look at what they show.,
  ,
,In a sneak peak, US President Joe Biden presented the very first image of Webb’s “deep field”. This is the massive galaxy cluster SMACS-0723 that contains thousands of galaxies clustered around a central super-bright galaxy squatting at the centre. ,You’ll immediately notice the many elongates arcs, representing background galaxies which have been , as a result of the cluster’s mass. In other words, the huge forces of gravity at play have resulted in the light from the galaxies becoming distorted (stretched) and amplified, providing a highly enhanced image of the distant universe.,The clarity is astonishing, especially in terms of the structure of the lensed images. Here’s a zoomed-in look at one tiny region, compared with an image of similar exposure time from Hubble:,The enlarged images above portray a region in the deep field containing a spiral galaxy astronomers have affectionately been calling “The Slug”. It’s located several times further than the SMACS-0723 cluster.,But our eyes were drawn more to the very thin arc just above (marked with arrows). This little sliver demonstrates Webb’s power. This arc was barely detected by Hubble, but Webb sees the “beads on a string” clearly. They are likely individual star clusters in the extremely distant, tiny galaxy. ,We can see similarly amazing details ,. For point-like objects, Webb is expected to be beyond 100 times more sensitive than Hubble, and this definitely demonstrates that. ,The field is also scattered with some faint red objects, which are already attracting attention by experts. Some of these could potentially be the most distant galaxies, where the light has taken the longest to reach us. ,Webb is also capable of extremely sensitive infrared spectroscopy, where light is broken down in wavelengths to reveal the composition of an object. ,While Hubble is very poor at this, Webb manages to do this nicely – shown below by the spectrum of the massive planet WASP 96b. Located some 1120 light-years away, this planet weighs in at about half the mass of Jupiter.,The dips in the spectrum reveal the presence of water vapour in the planet’s atmosphere. Now, WASP 69b is unlikely to harbour life because of its proximity to its parent star. Yet this demonstration is very exciting since the same method can be applied to the 5,000 or so other known exoplanets.,With spectroscopy, we’ll eventually be able to detect potential signatures of life such as ozone and methane.,The third image is of the Southern Ring Nebula, about 2,000 light-years away in the Milky Way. This image shows off Webb’s mid-infrared capability (which is again well beyond Hubble’s range).,It’s a classic example of a “planetary nebula” (a misnomer since no planet is involved) in which the central star has transformed into a tiny white dwarf by blowing off its outer layer. This happens at a speed of about 15 kilometres per second, sending out rings of gas and dust. ,The brightest star in the centre is actually a companion star, and the white dwarf is the fainter partner which can only be seen in the mid-infrared since it’s obscured by dust. The mid-infared also highlights the dust being formed in the expanding gas.,The fourth image below shows us Webb’s view of nearby galaxies. Here we see a famous galaxy group called Stefan’s Quintet, located about 290 million light-years away. The five galaxies are in close proximity. Four are interacting with each other and triggering abundant star formation. ,The red streaks and clumps show the location of new star formation via the associated dust. The detail of the dust distribution and the tug-of-war taking place between the galaxies leaps out from the image. And the mid-infrared reveals light from a supermassive black hole in the centre of the top galaxy. ,What also stands out is the vast sea of distant galaxies in the background. We expect to see this in every Webb image, even when Webb points to sources within the Milky Way. That’s because infrared light passes through dust. Webb’s infrared-detecting capabilities are so sensitive it will see right through objects within our galaxy.,This means distant background galaxies will be photo-bombing every Webb image. See if you can spot them in the Southern Ring and Carina images.,And finally, we have Webb’s homage to Hubble’s famous , image.,This infrared view shows the Carina Nebula, a stellar nursery of gas and dust 7,600 light-years away where new stars are forming and destroying their birth cloud. ,The image is extremely complex, and the intricate swirls of dust, gas and young stars are jaw-dropping. It will probably take astronomers many years of hard work to figure out exactly what’s going on here. ,Just this handful of preview images, a few days work for Webb, have given astronomers tremendous amounts of new data that will drive years of research. And that’s just the beginning.","Published: July 13, 2022 4.25pm AEST",https://theconversation.com/two-experts-break-down-the-james-webb-space-telescopes-first-images-and-explain-what-weve-already-learnt-186738,"<li class=""topic-list-item"">

            Honeybees join humans as the only known animals that can tell the difference between odd and even numbers
          ","“Two, four, six, eight; bog in, don’t wait”. ,As children, we learn numbers can either be even or odd. And there are many ways to categorise numbers as even or odd.,We may memorise the rule that numbers ending in 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9 are odd while numbers ending in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 are even. Or we may divide a number by 2 – where any whole number outcome means the number is even, otherwise it must be odd. ,Similarly, when dealing with real-world objects we can use pairing. If we have an unpaired element left over, that means the number of objects was odd.,Until now odd and even categorisation, also called parity classification, had never been shown in non-human animals. In a new study, , in the journal Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution, we show honeybees can learn to do this.,Parity tasks (such as odd and even categorisation) are considered abstract and high-level ,.,Interestingly, humans demonstrate accuracy, speed, language and spatial relationship biases when categorising numbers as odd or even. For example, we , to even numbers with actions performed by our right hand, and to odd numbers with actions performed by our left hand. ,We are also faster, and more accurate, when categorising numbers as even compared to odd. And research has found children typically associate the word ,.,These studies suggest humans may have learnt biases and/or innate biases regarding odd and even numbers, which may have arisen either through evolution, cultural transmission, or a combination of both. ,It isn’t obvious why parity might be important beyond its use in mathematics, so the origins of these biases remain unclear. Understanding if and how other animals can recognise (or can learn to recognise) odd and even numbers could tell us more about our own history with parity.,Studies have shown honeybees can learn to ,, perform simple addition and subtraction, , and ,. ,
  ,
,To teach bees a parity task, we separated individuals into two groups. One was trained to associate even numbers with sugar water and odd numbers with a bitter-tasting liquid (quinine). The other group was trained to associate odd numbers with sugar water, and even numbers with quinine.,We trained individual bees using comparisons of odd versus even numbers (with cards presenting 1-10 printed shapes) until they chose the correct answer with 80% accuracy.,Remarkably, the respective groups learnt at different rates. The bees trained to associate odd numbers with sugar water learnt quicker. Their learning bias towards odd numbers was the opposite of humans, who categorise even numbers more quickly.,We then tested each bee on new numbers not shown during the training. Impressively, they categorised the new numbers of 11 or 12 elements as odd or even with an accuracy of about 70%. ,Our results showed the miniature brains of honeybees were able to understand the concepts of odd and even. So a large and complex human brain ,, and a miniature insect brain ,, could both categorise numbers by parity.,Does this mean the parity task was less complex than we’d previously thought? To find the answer, we turned to bio-inspired technology.,Artificial neural networks were one of the first learning algorithms developed for machine learning. Inspired by biological neurons, these networks are scalable and can tackle complex recognition and classification tasks using ,.,We constructed a simple artificial neural network with just five neurons to perform a parity test. We gave the network signals between 0 and 40 pulses, which it classified as either odd or even. Despite its simplicity, the neural network correctly categorised the pulse numbers as odd or even with 100% accuracy.,This showed us that , parity categorisation does not require a large and complex brain such as a human’s. However, this doesn’t necessarily mean the bees and the simple neural network used the same mechanism to solve the task.,We don’t yet know how the bees were able to perform the parity task. Explanations may include simple or complex processes. For example, the bees may have:,By teaching other animal species to discriminate between odd and even numbers, and perform other abstract mathematics, we can learn more about how maths and abstract thought emerged in humans.,Is discovering maths an inevitable consequence of intelligence? Or is maths somehow linked to the human brain? Are the differences between humans and other animals less than we previously thought? Perhaps we can glean these intellectual insights, if only we listen properly. ,

            Space debris is coming down more frequently. What are the chances it could hit someone or damage property?
          ","In the past week alone, we’ve seen two separate incidents of space debris hurtling back to Earth in unexpected places. ,On Saturday there was the uncontrolled re-entry of a Chinese Long March 5B rocket over Malaysia. Yesterday outlets reported on some spacecraft parts that , in regional New South Wales – now , to be from a SpaceX Crew-1 mission.,As the space industry grows, it’s safe to say such incidents will only become more frequent – and they could pose a risk. But how much of a risk, exactly?,Space debris refers to the leftover components of a space system that are no longer required. It might be a satellite that has reached the end of its life (such as the International Space Station), or parts of a rocket system that have fulfilled their purpose and are discarded.,
  ,
,To date, China has launched three Long March 5B rockets, and each has been deliberately left in an uncontrolled orbit. This means there was no way of knowing where they would land.,As for the SpaceX debris found in the Snowy Mountains, SpaceX de-orbits its rocket parts in a controlled fashion, and designs other components to burn up upon re-entry into Earth’s atmosphere. But as you can see from the latest news, these things don’t always go to plan.,So how dangerous is space debris, really?,Well, as far as we know only one person has ever been hit by it. Lottie Williams, a resident of Tulsa, Oklahoma, , , by a piece in 1997. It was about the size of her hand and thought to have come from a Delta II rocket. She picked it up, took it home and reported it to authorities the next day.,However, with more and more objects going into space, and coming back down, the chances of someone or something being struck are increasing. This is especially true of large, uncontrolled objects such as the Long March 5B. ,Of the three times this model of rocket has been launched:,There are many different estimates of the chances of space debris hitting someone, but most are in the , range. This is the chance of , person being hit, anywhere in the world. However, the chances of a , person being hit (such as you or me) is in the order of ,. ,There are several factors behind these estimates, but let’s just focus on one key one for now. The image below shows the orbital path the recent Long March 5B-Y3 rocket followed for its final 24 hours (different objects take different orbital paths), as well as its re-entry location marked in red.,As you can see, the rocket orbits above land for a substantial amount of time. ,Specifically, in these orbits the vehicle spends about 20% of its time over land. A broad estimate tells us 20% of land is inhabited, which means there is a 4% chance of the Long March 5B re-entry occurring over an inhabited area. ,This may seem pretty high. But when you consider how much “inhabited land” is actually covered by people, the likelihood of injury or death becomes significantly less. ,The chance of damage to property, on the other hand, is higher. It could be as high as 1% for any given re-entry of the Long March 5B. ,Also, the overall risk posed by space debris will increase with the sheer number of objects being launched and re-entering the atmosphere. Current plans of companies and space agencies around the world involve many, many more launches. ,China’s Tiangong Space Station is , be finished by the end of the year. And South Korea recently , the seventh country to launch a satellite payload heavier than one tonne – with plans to , its space sector (, Japan, Russia, India and United Arab Emirates).,It’s highly likely the chances of being hit are only going to go up (but will hopefully remain very small).,Two questions come to mind:,Let’s start with predictions. It can be extremely challenging to predict where an object in an uncontrolled orbit will re-enter Earth’s atmosphere. The general rule of thumb says uncertainty of the estimated re-entry time will be between 10% and 20% of the remaining orbital time. ,This means an object with a predicted re-entry time in ten hours will have an uncertainty margin of about one hour. So if an object is orbiting Earth every 60-90 minutes, it could enter pretty much anywhere. ,Improving on this uncertainty margin is a big challenge and will require significant amounts of research. Even then, it’s unlikely we’ll be able to predict an object’s re-entry location more accurately than within a 1,000km range.,Reducing risk is a challenge, but there are a couple of options. ,First, all objects launched into an Earth orbit should have a plan for safe de-orbiting into an unpopulated area. This is usually the SPOUA (South Pacific Ocean Uninhabited Area) – also known as the “spacecraft cemetery”.,There’s also the option to carefully design components so they completely disintegrate upon re-entry. If everything burns up when it hits the upper atmosphere, there will no longer be a significant risk.,There are already some guidelines requiring space debris risk minimisation, such as the , for the Long-term Sustainability of Outer Space Activities – but the mechanisms for these aren’t specified. ,Moreover, how do these guidelines apply internationally, and who can enforce them? Such questions remain unanswered.,In summary, should you be concerned about being hit by space debris? For now, no. Is further research on space debris important for the future? Absolutely.,

            Is there evidence aliens have visited Earth? Here’s what’s come out of US congress hearings on ‘unidentified aerial phenomena’
          ","The United States Congress recently held a hearing into US government information , “unidentified aerial phenomena” (UAPs). ,The last investigation of this kind happened more than 50 years ago, as part of a US Air Force investigation called ,, which examined reported sightings of unidentified flying objects (note the change in name). ,The current hearings are the result of a stipulation attached to a ,, which required US Intelligence agencies to produce a report on UAPs within 180 days. That , appeared in June last year. ,But why would governments be interested in UAPs? One exciting line of thought is UAPs are alien spacecraft visiting Earth. It’s a concept that gets a lot of attention, by playing on decades of sci-fi movies, views about what goes on in ,, and purported sightings by the public.,A much more prosaic line of thought is governments are interested in unexplained aerial phenomena – especially those within their own sovereign airspace – because they may represent technologies developed by an adversary. ,Indeed, most discussion at the recent hearing revolved around potential threats from UAPs, on the basis they were such human-made technologies.,None of the public testimony went any way towards supporting a conclusion that alien spacecraft have crashed on, or visited, Earth. The hearings did include closed classified sessions that presumably dealt with more sensitive security information.,There is no doubt unexplained phenomena have been observed, such as in footage obtained by navy pilots (above) showing fast moving airborne objects.  But the leap to aliens requires far more substantial and direct evidence – incredible evidence – that can be widely scrutinised using the tools of science.,After all, the existence of life elsewhere in the universe is a fascinating question of science and society. So the , is a legitimate pursuit, subject to the same burden of evidence that applies to all science.,On and off over the past decade, I’ve used radio telescopes to perform wide ranging experiments to search , – signs of technological civilisations on planets elsewhere in our galaxy (the Milky Way). But after decades of many teams of experts using powerful telescopes, we still haven’t covered much territory.  ,If the Milky Way is considered equivalent to the Earth’s oceans, the sum total of our decades of searching is like taking a random swimming pool worth of water out of the ocean to search for a shark. ,On top of that, we’re not even sure sharks exist and, if they do, what they would look like or how they would behave. While I believe life will almost certainly exist among the trillions of planets in the universe – the sheer scale of the universe is a problem.,
  ,
,The vast volume of the universe makes it very difficult to achieve interstellar travel, receive signals, or communicate with any potential far-off lifeforms (at least according to the laws of physics as we know them).,Speeds are limited to the ,, which is around 300,000 km per second. It’s pretty fast. But even at that speed it would take a signal roughly four years to travel between Earth and , in our galaxy, which is four light years away.,But Einstein’s theory of special relativity tells us that, in practice, the speed of a physical object such as a spacecraft will be slower than the speed of light.,Also, thanks to the ,, signals get weaker in proportion to the square of the distance they have travelled. Over interstellar distances, that’s a killer. ,So for planets hundreds or thousands of light years away, travel times are likely in the many thousands of years. And any signals originating from civilisations on those planets are incredibly weak and difficult to detect.,Could it be aliens , crashed on Earth and the US government is just covering it up, as Republican Congressman , claimed in ,?,For airlines belonging to the International Air Transport Association, the chance of plane crash is about ,. That begs the question: do we think an alien spacecraft that can travel for thousands of years, across interstellar distances, is more robust and better designed than our planes? ,Let’s say it’s a hundred times better. Which means the chance of a crash is one in a hundred million. So to end up with alien wreckage stashed away at Area 51, we would need one hundred million visits from alien spacecraft. That would be 2,739 visits from aliens per day, every day, for the past 100 years!,So, where are they? The near-Earth environment should be constantly buzzing with aliens.,With ,, billions of mobile phone cameras, and hundreds of thousands of amateur astronomers photographing the sky (as well as professional astronomers with powerful telescopes), there should be a lot of really good evidence in the hands of the general public and scientists – not just governments.,It’s much more likely the UAPs presented in evidence are home-grown, or due to natural phenomena we don’t yet understand. ,In science, , is still a great starting point; the best explanation is the simplest explanation consistent with the known facts. Until there is much more – and much, much better evidence – let’s conclude aliens haven’t visited yet.,I can’t lie though, I’m hoping I’ll see a time when that evidence exists.  Until then, I’ll keep searching the skies to do my bit.","Published: May 20, 2022 11.50am AEST",https://theconversation.com/is-there-evidence-aliens-have-visited-earth-heres-whats-come-out-of-us-congress-hearings-on-unidentified-aerial-phenomena-183443,"<li class=""topic-list-item"">

            Do AI systems really have their own secret language?
          ","A new generation of artificial intelligence (AI) models can produce “creative” images on-demand based  on a text prompt. The likes of ,, ,, and , are beginning to , with implications for copyright and intellectual property.,While the output of these models is often striking, it’s hard to know exactly how they produce their results. Last week, researchers in the US made the intriguing claim that the DALL-E 2 model might have invented its own secret language to talk about objects.,By prompting DALL-E 2 to create images containing text captions, then feeding the resulting (gibberish) captions back into the system, the researchers concluded DALL-E 2 thinks , means “,”, while , refers to “,”.,These claims are fascinating, and if true, could have important security and interpretability implications for this kind of large AI model. So what exactly is going on?,DALL-E 2 probably does not have a “secret language”. It might be more accurate to say it has its own , – but even then we can’t know for sure.,First of all, at this stage it’s very hard to verify any claims about ,, because only a handful of researchers and creative practitioners have access to them. Any images that are publicly shared (on Twitter for example) should be taken with a fairly large grain of salt, because they have been “cherry-picked” by a human from among many output images generated by the AI.,
  ,
,Even those with access can only use these models in limited ways. For example, DALL-E 2 users can generate or modify images, but can’t (yet) interact with the AI system more deeply, for instance by modifying the behind-the-scenes code. This means “,” methods for understanding how these systems work can’t be applied, and systematically investigating their behaviour is challenging.,One possibility is the “gibberish” phrases are related to words from non-English languages. For instance, ,, which seems to create images of birds, is similar to the Latin ,, which is the binomial name of a family of bird species.,This seems like a plausible explanation. For instance, DALL-E 2 was trained on a very wide variety of data scraped from the internet, which included many non-English words. ,Similar things have happened before: large natural language AI models have coincidentally , without deliberate training. ,One point that supports this theory is the fact that AI language models don’t read text the way you and I do. Instead, they break input text up into “tokens” before processing it. ,Different , have different results. Treating each word as a token seems like an intuitive approach, but causes trouble when identical tokens have different meanings (like how “match” means different things when you’re playing tennis and when you’re starting a fire).,On the other hand, treating each character as a token produces a smaller number of possible tokens, but each one conveys much less meaningful information.,DALL-E 2 (and other models) use an in-between approach called , (BPE). Inspecting the BPE representations for some of the gibberish words suggests this could be an important factor in understanding the “secret language”.,The “secret language” could also just be an example of the “garbage in, garbage out” principle. DALL-E 2 can’t say “I don’t know what you’re talking about”, so it will always generate some kind of image from the given input text.,Either way, none of these options are complete explanations of what’s happening. For instance, removing individual characters from gibberish words appears to ,. And it seems individual gibberish words don’t necessarily combine to produce , (as they would if there were really a secret “language” under the covers). ,Beyond intellectual curiosity, you might be wondering if any of this is actually important.,The answer is yes. DALL-E’s “secret language” is an example of an “adversarial attack” against a machine learning system: a way to break the intended behaviour of the system by intentionally choosing inputs the AI doesn’t handle well. ,One reason adversarial attacks are concerning is that they challenge our confidence in the model. If the AI interprets gibberish words in unintended ways, it might also interpret meaningful words in unintended ways.,Adversarial attacks also raise security concerns. DALL-E 2 filters input text to prevent users from generating harmful or abusive content, but a “secret language” of gibberish words might allow users to circumvent these filters. ,Recent research has discovered adversarial “,” for some language AI models – short nonsense phrases such as “zoning tapping fiennes” that can reliably trigger the models to spew out racist, harmful or biased content. This research is part of the ongoing effort to ,  how complex deep learning systems learn from data.,Finally, phenomena like DALL-E 2’s “secret language” raise interpretability concerns. We want these models to behave as a human expects, but seeing structured output in response to gibberish confounds our expectations. ,You may recall the hullabaloo in 2017 over some Facebook chat-bots that “,”. The present situation is similar in that the results are concerning – but not in the “Skynet is coming to take over the world” sense. ,Instead, DALL-E 2’s “secret language” highlights existing concerns about the robustness, security, and interpretability of ,.,
  ,
,Until these systems are more widely available – and in particular, until users from a broader set of non-English cultural backgrounds can use them – we won’t be able to really know what is going on. ,In the meantime, however, if you’d like to try generating some of your own AI images you can check out a freely available smaller model, ,. Just be careful which words you use to prompt the model (English or gibberish – your call).","Published: June 7, 2022 6.01am AEST",https://theconversation.com/do-ai-systems-really-have-their-own-secret-language-184335,"<li class=""topic-list-item"">

            Survey reveals ","COVID-19 has had a significant impact on all facets of our lives, including the ways we work and our work-life priorities.,Globally, workplaces are navigating trends such as the “,”, “,” and the “,”. But in New Zealand, the “great return” to work is still being negotiated, providing employees and employers an opportunity to redesign the workplace in ways that benefit both. ,One common theme in the employment trends to emerge during COVID-19 is a shift in the value people place on their work and their lives outside of work. But has this gone too far? Are workers being selfish – or “self-first”, as in putting their non-work preferences ahead of workplace productivity? ,Or are they prioritising personal wellbeing in order to be better employees? And are these global employment trends meaningful in the New Zealand context, where small and medium-sized companies (SMEs) dominate the business landscape? ,Our ongoing , found workplace practices and future working preferences have changed since 2020. Workers are looking for jobs that better fit their lives. The results suggest now is the time for employers to work with employees, rather than against them, for mutual benefit and increased productivity. ,More than two years after the first COVID-19 lockdowns, employers are calling their employees back to the office – but also having to respond to employee push-back. Employees are expecting and asking for more flexibility in where and when they work – they aren’t just quietly accepting the “old ways” of working. ,Workers have had a taste of work-life flexibility and are demanding this more frequently and with more confidence. Meanwhile, some employers are focused on “traditional” 40-hour weeks in the office, while others are offering flexibility in hours worked, work style and location. ,
  ,
,Tesla , to return to the office for 40 hours a week, or work elsewhere permanently. Apple’s , to return to the office was met with a , for a work-from-home policy, as implemented at Facebook and Twitter. The company eventually settled for a hybrid “two days at home, three days in the office” model. ,In the UK, a four-day work week , involving 70 companies is underway, while in Canada some workplaces are navigating the , from employees who have seen they can work in different places and during different hours and who now want a say in how, when, and where they do their job. ,Some businesses are mandating a return to the office while other Canadian businesses have , with no change in daily hours for employees. ,While similar trials are under way in ,, the big questions are whether employers need to worry about the actions of large, multinational companies (given SMEs make up approximately , of local businesses), and whether employees have the same desired future work-life preferences as workers overseas.,A quick search of vacancies on the job website Seek.com showed more than 700 jobs mentioned “working from home”, 5,000 mentioned “flexibility”, and 38,000 mentioned “work-life” in the job descriptions. Businesses clearly have the sense that staff preferences are changing. ,Our research provides insight on what employees want and why. We asked questions about when, where and how many hours they work, as well as the levels of autonomy they have in setting their own work patterns. We also asked what changes they had seen in their organisations since 2020. ,
  ,
,While more than half of the respondents (52%) said they had more flexibility in terms of their work arrangements compared to before COVID, and 62% agreed they were able to manage their work-life demands, two-thirds (67%) indicated they now wanted more work-life flexibility. ,Nearly half of the respondents (48%) reported that their organisation had already made formal policy changes to enable more work-life flexibility (not including temporary changes during the pandemic). Some 41% said they knew of employees who had left organisations because the employer did not provide enough flexibility to match their needs. ,Flexibility in this context meant control over their working patterns. Employees wanted to decide how, where and when they carried out their work. This does not necessarily mean only working from home, but start and end times, number of daily hours worked, and preferred locations such as the homes of friends and family, cafes, libraries and shared open spaces.,
  ,
,The dominant reason for people seeking greater flexibility was personal wellbeing (60%) – above family care, lifestyle, community involvement, fewer interruptions and increased productivity. ,We also found 77% of respondents wanted to feel a strong sense of belonging to their organisation. Despite wanting more control of their working patterns, including not necessarily being in the same building as their colleagues, respondents still wanted to be part of an organisation – just in a different way. ,The survey results offer local employers an opportunity to work with employees, rather than face the backlash that has been seen overseas. ,With record low unemployment, employees are seeking organisations that are responding to the shift in employee values. Employers need to look past what might appear, on the surface, to be employee selfishness and accommodate the new “self-first” preferences in the post-COVID environment.  ,By embracing the preferences of their workers, employers can show they value employees and employee wellbeing, which might help navigate the best options for employees – including helping set the new “rules” of working and where compromises might take place.,Remember, employees want a sense of belonging to something bigger. But they also understand the importance of taking care of themselves first. It is time for employees and employers to work together to carve out the mutual benefits of finding new ways of working.","Published: September 16, 2022 11.45am AEST",https://theconversation.com/survey-reveals-two-thirds-of-nz-employees-want-more-work-life-flexibility-how-should-employers-respond-189879,"<li class=""topic-list-item"">

            New Zealand’s new ","New Zealand’s decision to end most COVID health measures is welcome, as it removes controls that are in most cases no longer essential. But the new , looks like a short-term reaction to declining case numbers rather than a longer-term strategy.,New Zealand has achieved one of the , by taking decisive action from the start of the pandemic. ,We argue now is the time to build on that success with a strong, science-informed strategy to get us through the next pandemic stages and lift our resilience against future emerging infectious disease threats.,Such a strategy would need to provide a robust plan for managing the two most likely pandemic scenarios – new variants and endemic disease.,The most probable scenario is that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, will continue to evolve new variants that evade immunity from prior infection or vaccination, triggering new waves. Any new variant , than Omicron. ,The government has previously identified the need for a ,, which would require rapid risk assessment of new threats and increased controls if needed.,
  ,
,COVID is also likely to eventually become a more stable and predictable endemic disease, perhaps somewhat like seasonal influenza but with , that are still emerging. ,Endemic does not necessarily mean ,. The world’s biggest infectious disease killers, including tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and malaria, are all endemic. A long-term strategy should aim to minimise health burdens (serious illness, death and ,) and health inequities.,Unfortunately, New Zealand’s new approach does not provide a robust response to either of these scenarios. ,New Zealand already has well-established tools for assessing and communicating the risk associated with many other hazards such as fires and storms. Why not do the same for COVID and potentially other serious respiratory infections?,We propose five changes to fill gaps in the new COVID management approach while at the same time minimising disruptions.,The government could use this relatively low point in the number of COVID cases to develop a robust framework to provide a simple way for , and a proportionate response at each level. ,Before COVID, New Zealand’s , was based on mitigation. This meant accepting pandemics would wash over the country and the best we could do was to minimise healthcare system overload. Now we know we can potentially ,. ,We need an evidence-informed strategy for our borders to manage potentially more dangerous variants and other future pandemics. ,The government has now removed vaccination requirements and mandated testing for visitors. As case numbers fall, arriving travellers will likely become an increasingly important source of new infections. ,The end of routine testing on arrival limits our ability to collect viral samples for , and leaves a gap in our surveillance system. Long-term benefits of improved border control would include a reduced risk of importing other outbreak-prone diseases such as , or ,.,Fortunately, the government has retained mandatory isolation for people who test positive for COVID. It is fundamental to disease control that sick people stay home. Keeping isolation to a minimum of seven days is also wise, as even then about a ,. ,Nevertheless, adding a , requirement would improve the effectiveness of this strategy and reduce the isolation period to five days for some. ,Making these measures work well requires a great deal more public education and support, particularly around health, social and work support. This could be a major legacy benefit of this pandemic, particularly if it also helps to reduce the spread of other respiratory diseases such as ,.,
  ,
,Masks still have to be worn in healthcare and aged-care settings. Masks work best in such high-risk environments when ,. But we need systematic criteria to identify other confined, crowded and close-contact environments with a high risk of infection. ,On that basis, public transport would be an important environment for universal mask use and ,, particularly ,. An evidence-based mask and ventilation policy would be another major legacy benefit of the current pandemic., ,The government has now removed all vaccine mandates. However, there are several reasons why , and other essential workers should be vaccinated against COVID and other serious infectious diseases. It should be a basic occupational health and safety necessity, just like some groups are required to wear personal protective equipment. ,One legacy benefit of the pandemic should be a wider discussion about how to appropriately establish vaccination as a requirement for key occupational groups.,The inconvenient truth is that the pandemic has not gone away and future pandemics remain a risk. Even if COVID becomes a more predictable endemic disease, we still need to minimise serious illness, particularly for the most vulnerable.","Published: September 16, 2022 12.48pm AEST",https://theconversation.com/new-zealands-new-cut-down-covid-response-is-a-missed-opportunity-here-are-5-ways-to-improve-it-190737,"<li class=""topic-list-item"">

            This finals season, a brief ‘priming’ workout could boost performance on the sports field and beyond
          ","As humans, it is in our nature to want to do better, find that edge and succeed. This couldn’t be truer than in sport, where winning and losing are often separated by ,, a successful ,, or a split-second decision. ,So, there is always a need for effective and legal strategies to boost  performance. “Priming” is a tool , from athletes, coaches and scientists. ,The good news is it is not just for elite athletes. ,Priming, also called “morning exercise”, “pre-activation” or “pre-competition training”, has attracted renewed interest among scientists in recent years. Many sporting teams are already on the ball, with , to help their athletes gain a performance advantage. ,Typically, a relatively brief and non-tiring bout of exercise is performed the day before or on the morning of a competition – somewhere between ,. This stimulus to the muscles results in “,”. That is, the muscles can perform better after several hours of rest than they would have without the priming exercise. ,In contrast, a warm-up takes place much closer to competition. What’s interesting is the benefits of priming are much longer-lasting than those typical of warm-up activation strategies. This is perplexing because we know that increases in , with warm-ups return to baseline levels within minutes.  ,Warm-ups remain important but priming sessions could provide an additional edge. Sports scientists have reported improvements in running, jumping, throwing and weightlifting ability by as much as ,. This might not seem like a lot, but it’s crucial when the difference between winning and losing can be measured in fractions of a percentage point. The physiological mechanisms that cause the priming effect are not yet well understood, but neuromuscular and hormonal changes have been ,.,And it may not be only muscles that benefit. Researchers have long known priming exercise can improve weightlifting performance ,. More recent research reinforces the idea priming activities can help ,.,
  ,
,Very few of us are elite, full-time athletes. Finding time to train and compete, even at a community or sub-elite level, is hard – let alone making extra time for additional priming sessions. But priming exercises can be done with minimal equipment in minimal time. ,Basic exercises such as squats and bench presses with relatively heavy weights (around 85% of your maximum capacity) , are enough to boost performance later that day. ,Don’t have a rack of weights lying around? That’s OK. Explosive body-weight activities such as a few short , or , still have the potential to boost athletic performance. Stronger people ,, likely because they , from exercise.,Ideally, pick an activity that uses the same muscle groups you will use during your sport, and do the priming exercise ,, as this seems to offer the most benefit and practicality. And remember, more is not better. You may be able to incorporate your priming session into your existing training regime.,Priming doesn’t just apply to sport; it may help in the gym and with learning new skills. ,A , showed bench-press and squat performance was greater in the afternoon if they were used as priming exercises that same morning. ,And ten to 30 minutes of aerobic exercise may ,. Moderately intense cycling has been shown to help musicians ,. However, these changes appear more immediate and short-lived than those that relate to athletic performance, taking effect and lasting minutes rather than hours.,
  ,
,There are still questions to be addressed when it comes to priming. ,Could priming be useful in sports like rugby, football and basketball? These sports require multiple high-intensity efforts, coupled with dynamic decision-making to score and beat an opponent.,More research is also needed to work out what’s happening in the body and what exercises should be done when for the most effective priming. As researchers, we’re exploring the effect of different priming routines on muscular strength and power, as well as repeat sprint performance and reaction time in strength athletes and football players. ,In particular, weightlifting protocols that provide strong stimulation, but minimise fatigue, seem promising. We expect the findings will be useful for coaches and athletes who want to improve athletic performance.","Published: September 16, 2022 11.46am AEST",https://theconversation.com/this-finals-season-a-brief-priming-workout-could-boost-performance-on-the-sports-field-and-beyond-188823,"<li class=""topic-list-item"">

            We may be underestimating just how bad ","Australia’s love for fuel-hungry and fuel-inefficient SUVs is hampering our ability to bring transport emissions down. SUVs make up half of all new car sales last year, a National Transport Commission , revealed this week – up from a quarter of all sales a decade ago.,As a result, the carbon emitted by all new cars sold in Australia dropped only 2% in 2021, the report found. Sales of battery electric vehicles tripled last year, but still make up just 0.23% of all cars and light commercial vehicles on our roads.,In internationally peer-reviewed , earlier this year, we measured the emissions of five SUVs driving around Sydney, and our findings suggest the situation may actually be worse than the new report finds. ,The National Transport Commission’s numbers are based on the “New European Drive Cycle” (NEDC) emissions test. Our research found the real-world emissions of SUVs are, on average, about 30% higher than the NEDC values. This means we are not reducing fleet average emissions by a few percent per year, but actually probably increasing them by a few percent every year. ,The transport sector is responsible for ,, ranking third behind the electricity and agriculture sector. The first year of the COVID pandemic only reduced transport carbon dioxide emissions by about 7%, compared to 2019 emission levels.,Overall, Australia’s pride in carbon-belching transport is evident by the fact transport CO₂ emissions have risen 14% between 2005 and 2020. ,
  ,
,SUVs are generally larger and heavier than other passenger cars, which means they need quite a bit more energy and fuel per kilometre of driving when compared with smaller, lighter cars.,Although SUV sales are ,, the Australian fleet is unique due to its large portion of SUVs in the on-road fleet, often with four-wheel-drive capability. ,According to the National Transport Commission report, sales of four-wheel-drives and utes surged by more than 43,000 in 2021, while large SUV sales rose by around 25,000. ,Rapidly shifting to electric cars is an important way to bring emissions down. But the report found in 2021, just 2.8% of Australia’s car sales were electric. Compare this to 17% in Europe, 16% in China and 5% in the United States. ,In Australia, there is still no option to buy an electric ute, and electric vehicles remain ,. ,There are a , scientists use to measure vehicle emissions. ,One popular method worldwide uses so-called “on-board portable emission monitoring systems”. These systems are effective because they enable second-by-second emissions testing under a variety of real-world driving conditions on the road. ,On the other hand, the New European Drive Cycle (NEDC) emissions test is conducted in the laboratory. It was also developed in the early 1970s and reflects unrealistic driving behaviour, because test facilities at the time could not deal with significant changes in speed.,We fitted five SUVs with a portable emission monitoring system and drove them a little over 100 kilometres around Sydney in various situations, such as in the city and on the freeway.,We then compared our measurements with the , – the national guide to vehicle fuel consumption and environmental performance, which is also based on the NEDC test.,Our measurements of fuel consumption and CO₂ emissions were consistently higher. This varied from ,, depending on the actual car and driving conditions. ,On average, real-world fuel consumption and CO₂ emissions were both 27% higher than NEDC values. Importantly, this gap has increased substantially from ,.,Indeed, , from 2019 found fleet average greenhouse gas emissions for new Australian cars and SUVs has probably been increasing by 2-3% percent per year since 2015, rather than the reported annual reduction by, for instance, the National Transport Commission. ,This detailed analysis showed a sustained increase in vehicle weight and a shift to the sale of more four-wheel-drive cars (in other words, SUVs) are probably the main factors contributing to this change. , summarised the results of various emission measurement campaigns conducted in Australia and compared them with international studies. These include results from a study of vehicle emissions in a tunnel, and a study of vehicle emissions measured on the road with remote sensing.,We found modern diesel SUVs and cars or diesel light commercial vehicles (such as utes) in Australia and New Zealand have relatively high emissions of nitrogen oxides and soot – both important air pollutants. , are attributed to fine-particle air pollution in Australia each year. Transport and industrial activities (such as mining) are the main sources of this. ,And in 2015, an , were attributed to vehicle exhaust emissions – 42% more than the road toll that year.,
  ,
,The , suggest 1% of one to two-year-old diesel SUVs and 2% of one-to-two year old diesel light commercial vehicles have issues with their particulate filters, leading to high soot emissions. ,These percentages are high when compared with a , conducted in the United Kingdom, which could not find any clear evidence of filter issues.,Ever increasing SUVs sales are a drag on successfully reducing Australia’s total greenhouse gas emissions. So what should we do? ,Of course there are several things to consider, but in terms of fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions, we believe there are three main points.,First, we need to make sure we have realistic fuel use and emissions data. This means the National Transport Commission and Green Vehicle Guide should stop using the NEDC values and shift to more realistic emissions data. We acknowledge this is not a simple matter and it requires a lot more testing. ,Second, , electrify transport as fast as we can, wherever we can. This is crucial, but not the whole solution.,
  ,
,To ensure Australia meets its net-zero emissions target, we also need to seriously consider energy and fuel efficiency in transport. This could be by promoting the sales of smaller and lightweight vehicles, thereby optimising transport for energy efficiency.,In all of this, it will be essential for car manufacturers to take responsibility for their increasing contributions to climate change. From this perspective, they should move away from marketing profitable fossil-fueled SUVs that clog up our roads, and instead offer and promote lighter, smaller and electric vehicles.","Published: September 16, 2022 3.16pm AEST",https://theconversation.com/we-may-be-underestimating-just-how-bad-carbon-belching-suvs-are-for-the-climate-and-for-our-health-190743,"<li class=""topic-list-item"">

            God save the King: why the monarchy is safe in Aotearoa New Zealand – for now
          ","New Zealanders with republican or just plain anti-monarchy sympathies will have been disappointed (though maybe not surprised) that the Queen’s death has not triggered a more critical conversation about the country’s constitutional future.,Quite the opposite, in fact, if the prime minister is right. Far from representing a possible inflexion point in the nation’s post-Elizabethan development, Jacinda Ardern has suggested the nation’s close connection to the royal family would , under Charles III.,If so, it would put New Zealand in the vanguard of colonial loyalty. ,, of course, has recently taken the republican route, as have 35 other former British colonies or dependencies. ,, , and other Caribbean nations are setting off down that path, and there is also the prospect , will join them at some point. ,Indeed, of the 56 nations that are part of the Commonwealth, only 14 still , as head of state.,And yet, despite the future of the monarchy fast becoming a subject of debate around the remainder of the Commonwealth, it seems unlikely that much republican chatter will be heard any time soon in Aotearoa New Zealand.,This lack of enthusiasm for a debate is a little perplexing. It’s not as if ,. The New Zealand Republican Party was even briefly (and unsuccessfully) involved in electoral politics in the late 1960s.,At the Labour Party’s 1973 national conference, a remit to declare the country a republic was debated but scuttled. And in 1994, then prime minister Jim Bolger suggested New Zealand should look to achieve republican status by 2001. He was clearly ahead of his time.,There has been at least one more recent attempt to get the republican ball rolling. In late 2009, Green MP Keith Locke had his , drawn from the parliamentary ballot. ,
  ,
,Had Locke’s bill been successful (it wasn’t, dipping out at the first reading by 15 votes), there would have been a referendum on remaking the governor-general as the ceremonial head of a parliamentary (rather than a presidential) republic.,And it is not that New Zealand isn’t constitutionally innovative or reluctant to have constitutional conversations. In 1951, it , and in the mid-1990s adopted , for national elections. ,Debates about the place of , are a regular feature of public life, in which consideration has long been given to , that fit Aotearoa’s unique history and society.,There may be several reasons why republicanism has not captured the public mood here ,. For a start, there are simply always more pressing political priorities – right now including the ,, entrenched , and , inequalities, and the ,. ,Not many prime ministers would voluntarily expend political capital on a debate few New Zealanders appear to find especially relevant.,
  ,
,Second, it may be that in an age of political polarisation, the idea of a head of state who is not only unelected but also happens to live a , appeals to those for whom politics has become distastefully partisan. In trying times, the pull of tradition and constancy is strong for some people.,A third reason lies in the significance of the relationship between Māori and the Crown, provided for by the cornerstone of the nation’s constitutional architecture, Te Tiriti o Waitangi.,The particulars of that relationship are ,, but there is a view that replacing the Crown (as an institution) with something homegrown would disrupt the partnership it represents. The Crown may well be the historic coloniser, but for that very reason it is the Crown which must engage in the conversation about decolonisation.,Of course, there are many New Zealanders for whom republicanism makes perfectly good sense. In part, that’s because, since the advent of responsible government in 1856, “the Crown” has effectively meant the political executive, not the person of the monarch. It is the prime minister and cabinet who govern, not the head of state.,There is, too, the basic weirdness of retaining a monarch who becomes head of state by virtue of having been born into one , domiciled on the other side of the world.,
  ,
,Which means, of course, that no actual New Zealander (nor for that matter anyone who is ,) can ever be the head of state of New Zealand. (Happily those proscriptions do not apply to the monarch’s representative, ,.),This quirk of history notwithstanding, there is little to suggest the accession of a new monarch is about to generate a wave of republican sentiment in Aotearoa. And yet, the republican conversation has already been held in India, Barbados and Fiji, and is well under way across the Caribbean.,When and if that discussion , again, the promise – or spectre – of republicanism will be right next door. By then, memories of a monarch who ruled over the end of empire for 70 years will have started to fade. All bets will be off.","Published: September 15, 2022 8.33am AEST",https://theconversation.com/god-save-the-king-why-the-monarchy-is-safe-in-aotearoa-new-zealand-for-now-190656,"<li class=""topic-list-item"">

            Grattan on Friday: Defeat of the Voice would be a body blow for achieving a republic
          ","The passage of the proposed referendum on a Voice to Parliament could be a necessary, albeit not a sufficient, condition for Australia to become a republic in the next few years.,Anthony Albanese, on grounds of respect, is declining to be drawn on the republic issue immediately after the queen’s death. Assistant Minister for the Republic Matt Thistlethwaite has lips buttoned (although he was embarrassed when Sky publicised a fundraising dinner he was slated to attend next month). ,Albanese’s bid to change Australia’s constitutional arrangements has been pencilled in for a second term, assuming Labor gets one. Thistlethwaite’s early appointment both sent a signal and marked the start of tilling the ground, initially in a low-key way. ,A defeat for the Voice, however, would potentially be a massive stumbling block. It’s hard to see the government being willing to risk a second referendum rebuff.  On the other hand, a win for the Voice would create momentum for a republic referendum, ending the perception that constitutional change has become almost impossible.,Assuming the Voice were enshrined, the push for the republic would still face formidable obstacles, arguably tougher than when people voted it down in 1999. ,Then, despite the result, there had been a strong mood for change. The controversial role of the governor-general in the 1975 political crisis was in relatively near memory; now it is ancient history for most people. And in the 1990s, moving to a republic was cast as important for Australia’s foreign policy pitch to Asia.  ,Today, the  republic issue faces a deal of inertia, despite predictions its time would come after the queen’s reign. Maybe in another three years enthusiasm would gear up, but there is no certainty. ,A republican identity no longer seems as vital for Australia’s presence internationally. That’s established. ,
  ,
,A Roy Morgan Research SMS poll on Monday of 1,012 people found 60% favoured Australia remaining a monarchy; 40% supported a move to a republic with an elected president. ,Backing for the status quo was higher among women and older people.,A discount factor might apply to a poll this week, but the long-term trend is revealing. ,Roy Morgan CEO Michele Levine said more Australians have been in favour of remaining as a monarchy than becoming a republic consistently since November 2010. ,
  ,
,Prior to that there had been a consistent majority in favour of becoming a republic from 1994 to 2008, she said.,In the public mind, a main reason for keeping the present system seems to be the “if it isn’t broken, don’t fix it” argument. People have become apathetic.  ,Once the republic debate was seriously re-ignited, though, apathy would turn into sharp division. For those seeking change, the “wicked problem” would become – as it was in 1999 – the model. ,The planned model in 1999 had a president appointed by two-thirds of the federal parliament. That would ensure bipartisanship and enable minimum alteration to the detail of the constitutional arrangements. ,But some republicans wanted the president popularly elected, and this split helped kill the referendum. In the years since, support for popular election has only grown, to the point where it is almost impossible to envisage the public voting for a non-elected model.  ,
  ,
,The Australian Republic Movement has proposed a model in which the public would choose from a list of candidates nominated by federal, state and territory parliaments.,It’s easy to understand why the public, in this age of political distrust, would favour an elected rather than an appointed presidency. But it is a model fraught with challenges. ,An elected president would have his or her own mandate from the voters. This would mean the powers of the president would need to be very carefully codified, and this is difficult. ,The issue of powers is central because of the nature of the federal parliamentary system, in which the Senate can block supply, as happened in 1975, which led to the governor-general using his reserve  powers to sack the prime minister. ,More broadly and less dramatically, an elected president –  especially a popular figure who wanted to assert themselves – could come to be seen as an alternative source of authority to the prime minister. Groups with grievances against the government could get publicity by making appeals to the president. ,And how would an election for president be conducted? What sort of issues would candidates campaign on? Or would they not be allowed to “campaign”, but simply run on their CVs? ,While many commentators see dangers in setting up a potentially competing source of authority, John Quiggin, from The University of Queensland, has the opposite view. He argues that “the current system gives the prime minister too much power, and this power has been increasingly abused in Australia and other Westminster systems”. ,Quiggin dismisses the suggestion a president with their own authority deriving from the people could become too powerful.  ,“The parliamentary republic with which we share the most history, the Republic of Ireland, has an elected president, and the system has worked very well. Even though candidates for president have been supported by political parties, they appear not to have acted as partisans in office, and have left the running of the country to the PM,” Quiggin wrote on , this week.  ,Human rights barrister Geoffrey Robertson suggests a more radical course, asking: ,Criticising Governor-General David Hurley in relation to Scott Morrison’s power grab of multiple ministries, Robertson writes: “If the governor-general is to be no more than a cipher for the prime minister, why not write him – and the royal family – out of the Constitution entirely? ,""Our elected leader could be sworn in by the chief justice – as in America – and the democratic process can be left to resolve itself according to accepted Westminster conventions subject to any necessary supervision by the High Court.”,Well, that would be a budget saving –  but it’s not an option we’d see on the Albanese government’s agenda. ,The attitude of the opposition would be critical to the chances of a republic referendum succeeding. Liberals are split over a republic. “I don’t agree with a republic,” Opposition Leader Peter Dutton declared on Thursday. Of course in a second Labor term there could well be another Liberal leader. ,Although Thistlethwaite is quiet at the moment, he was expansive in an interview the Sydney Morning Herald published days before the queen’s death. ,“I think you’ve got to have the Australian people involved at every stage,” he said. “It might involve a plebiscite. It might involve some form of constitutional commission or convention.”,He said the Voice “should come first because that’s the great injustice in our Constitution”.,“If we can right that wrong with a referendum the next natural progression is […] shouldn’t we have one of our own as head of state? It’s time for the kids to grow up and leave home.”,Thistlethwaite did not speculate about where things might stand if the wrong was not righted.","Published: September 15, 2022 8.49pm AEST",https://theconversation.com/grattan-on-friday-defeat-of-the-voice-would-be-a-body-blow-for-achieving-a-republic-190747,"<li class=""topic-list-item"">

            We can predict final school marks in year 11 – it’s time to replace stressful exams with more meaningful education
          ","Year 12 students around Australia are preparing to sit their final exams.
For many young people this is one of the most stressful parts of school, with their future ,.,This is an outdated way of finishing school and working out what students do in the next phase of their lives. ,Universities and TAFEs are increasingly using other methods – such as interviews or portfolios – to offer places to school leavers. In 2021, more than 25,000 NSW students applied for an , through the “schools recommendation scheme”, to lock in a university place before they sit their exams. This is up from 5,447 in 2014, suggesting year 12 exams may not be as necessary as we once thought.,Our research shows you can reliably predict a student’s year 12 results by year 11. This also suggests we don’t need a battery of stressful exams to work out if a student is suited for tertiary education. ,This gives us the opportunity to radically rethink how the final years of school are structured. ,Two years ago, we , more than 10,000 students in the Catholic Education Diocese of Paramatta, NSW. We have repeated the study and our work now includes 20,000 students across 21 exam areas.,We used , which links multiple pieces of information about student progression through school. ,We used 17 variables including year 9 NAPLAN scores, Higher School Certificate subject choices and year 11 attendance. We also use demographic information, such as how long a student has lived in Australia and a school’s socioeconomic rating. ,Across both our studies, we found we could predict year 12 results in year 11, with a 93% accuracy rate.,Our purpose here is not to label students, but to change the focus of school and the efforts of students and teachers. ,We are already seeing the beginnings of , of “doing school” in Australia. Some schools are changing their focus from year 12 exams to students doing internships, creating portfolios of work, doing TAFE or university certificates, or doing an overseas exchange. ,In British Columbia, Canada, final school assessments include a project that connects “real-world” applications of the curriculum for each student.,
  ,
,In Estonia, now among the world leaders in education, traditional “knowledge and understanding” approaches have been replaced with a strong emphasis on critical thinking, problem-solving, entrepreneurship, digital skills and citizenship. These are all qualities that fit with both employers’ needs and measures of success in the adult world. ,Students undertake a cross-disciplinary , to graduate from the equivalent of year 10 – an example might be studying the impact of music on managing the onset of dementia in older people. They then do a research project before finishing high school. ,High school as we’ve known it has been dominated by high stakes, high-pressure exams that have outlived their usefulness. If we can reliably predict the results, we don’t need the tests. ,We know young people’s mental health is already poor, and has , during COVID.,
  ,
,We should be looking for ways to improve, rather than exacerbate this. We also know  universities are increasingly open to other ways of admitting students. ,There is an enormous opportunity here to reallocate resources and create a modern, meaningful school experience that excites young people. It can encourage them to seek career-building activities, study overseas, learn languages or follow passion projects – not just study for stressful exams that tell us what we already know.

            Russia is building a closer alliance with the world’s autocracies – the west should beware
          ","Russia is planning to buy “millions” of Soviet-era weapons from North Korea, a recent , revealed. , has also confirmed that Russia is already using Iranian-made drones in Ukraine. ,The revelations follow a , between Russian president Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un to celebrate North Korea’s Liberation Day on August 15. The two leaders proposed a new strategic and tactical cooperation, and stressed the tradition of friendship between them, part of a recent Putin offensive to create and strengthen alliances with key authoritarian states. ,In just a few days Putin has met , and Iran’s president ,, as well as promising a major trade delegation to Iran. Putin also promised to do everything he could to make , of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, a political and security alliance that includes Russia, China, Uzbekistan and Pakistan.,As Russia becomes isolated from the west following its invasion of Ukraine, the Kremlin is becoming more ideologically extreme, and is seeking to improve its cooperation with rogue regimes, particularly North Korea and Iran. This alliance, which is likely to include China, could pose a real threat to the west in the coming years. ,Moscow enjoyed a close diplomatic relationship with Pyongyang during the cold war, and the Soviet Union was one of North Korea’s ,. The relationship changed dramatically in 1991 when the Soviet Union collapsed. Russia, no longer a communist country, focused on forging a positive relationship with western democracies. ,It prioritised economic relations over ideological ones, and sought to develop closer ties with the United States and South Korea. This ,, and North Korea shifted its focus to developing a closer relationship with China. ,When Putin came to power in 2000, he made attempts to ,.

The west must remain robust in its defence of democratic values and position itself as a necessary economic and strategic partner to autocratic regimes, or risk driving them further away.","Published: September 16, 2022 8.05pm AEST",https://theconversation.com/russia-is-building-a-closer-alliance-with-the-worlds-autocracies-the-west-should-beware-190708,"<li class=""topic-list-item"">

            US is becoming a ‘developing country’ on global rankings that measure democracy, inequality
          ","The United States may regard itself as a “,,” but an index of development released in July 2022 places the country much farther down the list. ,In its global rankings, the United Nations Office of Sustainable Development dropped the U.S. to ,, down from its previous ranking of 32nd. Under this methodology – an expansive model of 17  categories, or “goals,” many of them focused on the environment and equity – the U.S. ranks between Cuba and Bulgaria. Both are widely regarded as developing countries.,The U.S. is also now considered a “flawed democracy,” according to ,.,As a political historian who studies U.S. ,, I recognize these dismal ratings as the inevitable result of two problems. Racism has cheated many Americans out of the health care, education, economic security and environment they deserve. At the same time, as threats to democracy become more serious, a devotion to “American exceptionalism” keeps the country from candid appraisals and course corrections.,The Office of Sustainable Development’s rankings differ from more traditional development measures in that they are more focused on the experiences of ordinary people, including their ability to enjoy clean air and water, than the creation of wealth. ,So while the gigantic size of the American economy counts in its scoring, so too does unequal access to the wealth it produces. When judged by accepted measures like the ,, income inequality in the U.S. has risen markedly over the past 30 years. By the ,, the U.S. has the biggest wealth gap among G-7 nations.,These results reflect structural disparities in the United States, which are most pronounced for African Americans. Such differences have persisted well beyond the demise of chattel slavery and the repeal of Jim Crow laws.,Scholar W.E.B. Du Bois first exposed this kind of structural inequality in his 1899 analysis of Black life in the urban north, “,.”  Though he noted distinctions of affluence and status within Black society, Du Bois found the lives of African Americans to be a world apart from white residents: a “city within a city.” Du Bois traced the high rates of poverty, crime and illiteracy prevalent in Philadelphia’s Black community to discrimination, divestment and residential segregation – not to Black people’s degree of ambition or talent.,More than a half-century later, with characteristic eloquence, Martin Luther King Jr. , the persistence of the “other America,” one where “the buoyancy of hope” was transformed into “the fatigue of despair.” ,To illustrate his point, King referred to many of the same factors studied by Du Bois: the condition of housing and household wealth, education, social mobility and literacy rates, health outcomes and employment. On all of these metrics, , than whites. But as King noted, “Many people of various backgrounds live in this other America.”,The benchmarks of development invoked by these men also featured prominently in the 1962 book “,,” by political scientist , of a group that eventually became the Democratic Socialists of America. Harrington’s work so unsettled President John F. Kennedy that it reportedly , into formulating a “war on poverty.” ,Kennedy’s successor, Lyndon Johnson, waged this metaphorical war. But poverty ,. Rural areas and segregated neighborhoods stayed poor well beyond mid-20th-century federal efforts.,In large part that is because federal efforts during that critical time accommodated rather than confronted the forces of racism, ,. ,Across a number of policy domains, the sustained efforts of segregationist Democrats in Congress resulted in an incomplete and patchwork system of social policy. Democrats from the South cooperated with Republicans to doom to failure efforts to , , or ,. Rejecting proposals for strong federal intervention, they left a checkered legacy of , and ,. ,Today, many years later, the effects of a welfare state tailored to racism is evident — though perhaps less visibly so — in the inadequate , driving a , in average American life expectancy.,There are other ways to measure a country’s level of development, and on some of them the U.S. fares better. ,The U.S. currently ranks 21st on ,, which measures fewer factors than the sustainable development index. Good results in average income per person – $64,765 – and an average 13.7 years of schooling situate the United States squarely in the developed world.,Its ranking suffers, however, on appraisals that place greater weight on political systems. ,The Economist’s , now groups the U.S. among “flawed democracies,” with an overall score that ranks between Estonia and Chile. It falls short of being a top-rated “full democracy” in large part because of a fractured political culture. This growing divide is most apparent in the divergent paths between “red” and “blue” states.,Although the analysts from The Economist applaud the peaceful transfer of power in the face of an , it, , that, according to a January 2022 poll, “only 55% of Americans believe that Mr. Biden legitimately won the 2020 election, despite no evidence of widespread voter fraud.”, that election officials in Republican-controlled jurisdictions will reject or alter vote tallies that do not favor the Republican Party in upcoming elections, further jeopardizing the score of the U.S. on the democracy index.  ,Red and blue America also differ on access to modern reproductive care for women. This hurts the U.S. gender equality rating, , of the United Nations’ sustainable development index.,Since the , Roe v. Wade, Republican-controlled states have enacted or proposed grossly , ,, to the point of ,. ,I believe that, when paired with structural inequalities and fractured social policy, the dwindling Republican commitment to democracy lends weight to the classification of the U.S. as a developing country.,To address the poor showing of the United States on a variety of global surveys, one must also contend with the idea of ,, a belief in American superiority over the rest of the world. ,Both political parties have long promoted this belief, at home and abroad, but “exceptionalism” receives a more formal treatment from Republicans. It was the first line of the Republican Party’s national platform of , and , (“we believe in American exceptionalism”). And it served as the organizing principle behind Donald Trump’s vow to restore “,” to America’s schools. ,In Florida, after ,, the state board of education in July 2022 approved standards rooted in American exceptionalism while barring instruction in ,, an academic framework teaching the kind of structural racism Du Bois exposed long ago.,With a tendency to proclaim excellence rather than pursue it, the peddling of American exceptionalism encourages Americans to maintain a robust sense of national achievement – despite mounting evidence to the contrary.","Published: September 15, 2022 10.18pm AEST",https://theconversation.com/us-is-becoming-a-developing-country-on-global-rankings-that-measure-democracy-inequality-190486,"<li class=""topic-list-item"">

            10 months and hundreds of subjects: how I took portrait photography to the streets of Parramatta
          ","For the past ten months, I have photographed hundreds of people in the Western Sydney suburb of Parramatta for a portrait project called ,.  ,The portraits in the yearbook show the people who live, work and play in Parramatta against the backdrop of an ,.,The way a photographer and subject come together to make a portrait is usually invisible in a portrait. ,Here, instead of trying to reveal the elusive individuality of a person, I have been focusing on the social dynamics of portraiture – what happens behind the scenes between me and the people I’m photographing.,As Daniel Palmer notes in his book ,, portraiture is by definition relational and collaborative. That is, the process of photographic portraiture inherently brings the photographer and subjects together to arrive at an image.  ,In the context of this project, coming together for a portrait creates playful opportunities for social interactions among strangers. ,It is amazing what strangers will share with me in the space of five minutes. ,Two men reveal they are brothers and haven’t seen each other for ten years. ,One woman tells me she thinks she’s ugly and asks me to make her look beautiful. ,Another keenly describes the floral wonders she is holding from her community garden. ,One man whispers that he can’t speak English. ,Another tells me he’s in a hurry to go to lunch. ,We chat about the everyday things, the weather, COVID, shopping and Rugby League. ,There are stories of time spent in jail, and lives being turned around. ,New arrivals to Australia speak of their family in lands faraway and citizens who have lived all their lives in Parramatta share insights on the city. ,These are the stories photography can’t capture in the silent stillness of the image, but that’s no reason not to continue.,
  ,
,Setting up a studio in the street and inviting people to pose together in front of the camera is a thing to see. We always had audiences of passersby watching and it wasn’t long before they were also in front of the camera.  ,If you look closely at the portraits there are talkative details and warm gestures: micro-movements of the body where people touch each other or hold hands; the spaces between our bodies; instances when we are caught by the camera laughing, chatting and applying lipstick.,I also see myself in action. I am both photographer and subject, a stranger dressed in red, wanting desperately to be with people, to steer them through a photographic moment, to pose and be uncomfortable together.  ,When people have their portraits made I want to know whether they enjoyed it or found it excruciating and awkward. After the photo is taken, we walk up to the laptop tethered to the camera and look at the photographs. They indicate which portraits they like and hate. I listen and take notes. ,Involving people in the selection process creates instant trust. ,In bringing people together before a camera, I became acutely aware of photography’s potential to foster social inclusion, social participation, visibility and a sense of belonging and connection to one’s place and people.,Photography is something we all do. It is familiar and familial. Group portraits activate a social encounter and conversation, listening and storytelling. ,The social experience of photography is also extended through time. After the photographs have been taken and printed, they are displayed as a collage on a large scale photo wall in the heart of Parramatta in Centenary Square. I love watching people looking for themselves or pointing to familiar faces. ,As one passerby declared on seeing the photo wall: ,This feedback goes to the heart of the project that welcomed people from all walks of life to offer a view of Western Sydney that is far from the media stereotypes. ,Fundamentally, the Parramatta Yearbook acts as a model for how cultural institutions and government can work together with artists to record and reflect community, create a sense of belonging and produce narratives about a place in transition that foregrounds the creativity of its citizens ahead of urban development. ,

            The retirement of Roger Federer is the abdication of tennis royalty
          ","This is a time of endings. In the midst of the all-consuming , surrounding the death of Queen Elizabeth II, “tennis royalty” in the form of Roger Federer will , in the same week and in the same city that she is laid to rest.,When the career of a sporting celebrity concludes, it is widely represented as if they have died, in what journalists call “sports obituaries”.  ,The person in question is usually still alive and will probably go on to be successful in the business, media and/or charity sectors. But the experience of watching them perform live at the stadium or on screen immediately mutates into nostalgic reflection.,So, what can be said about the sporting life of “Roger”, one the few people often known solely by their given name?,
  ,
,When the institution of sport emerged during the late industrial revolution in the 19th century, it changed, as Allen Guttmann famously put it, “,”.  It became all about the numbers and the score.,By this measure, Federer’s sporting record is , – world men’s number one for the best part of six years, 20 Grand Slam singles titles (including six Australian Opens), the only player to win at least ten titles on clay, grass and hard court surfaces, and sundry other tennis achievements.,Of course, it has not all gone smoothly. The body that was his finely tuned instrument on the tennis court increasingly failed him, although the steely determination of the champion never wavered. ,Until, facing one last hurrah but probably playing on one leg, he chose to lower the curtain at the event that he co-created.,Named after his tennis hero, the , is a testament to Federer’s unusually intense immersion in tennis history and, ultimately, his own place within it. Federer, who arrived as a ,, admires not just the impressive tennis record but also the demeanour of ,.  ,An elegant and courteous stylist who was instrumental in the professionalisation of tennis in the 1960s, he has been a significant role model for Federer.,Laver is not just acknowledged as a superlative tennis player, but widely respected and admired. In emulating him, Federer generally behaved well on and off court, although unlike Laver, he sometimes wept with frustration or joy.  ,In the pure aesthetics of tennis, Federer arguably eclipsed the master. No cold-eyed counting of tournament wins can capture the beauty of his backhand, the flourish of his forehand.,In the early days of his career, the Swiss-South African Federer could have gone the way of Australian ,, who is more than a decade younger. Both supremely talented and combustible, Federer and Kyrgios went in different directions.,Federer became “,”, as he was anointed by the august Times of London in 2018 – a player who trained hard, curbed his temper, and won Wimbledon at the age of 21.  ,Kyrgios, by contrast, emerged as “,”, attracting media and spectator interest as much for his confrontational on-court antics as his sometimes sublime tennis.  ,Even if Kyrgios begins to win Grand Slams while continuing to , fans, it is unimaginable he will come close to Federer’s elevated place in the pantheon.,Federer’s place in tennis history has been enhanced in part by his membership of the “,” alongside Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic – or the “Big Four” if Andy Murray is included.  ,With more than 60 Grand Slams between them, the three rivals dominated men’s tennis, supplying the kind of “golden age” narrative so beloved of terminally sentimental sport fans.,Now, with Nadal also prone to injury and Djokovic sacrificing tournaments by refusing to be , against COVID, Federer’s retirement signals the end of this era. ,The departure of “,” from the women’s game and the youth of the singles winners in the 2022 US Open is further evidence that the wheel has, perhaps mercifully, turned in favour of renewal.,But longevity is a major aspect of Federer’s status. He has been at or near the top of tennis for most of the 21st century. ,Just as most people have only known one Queen of England, young and middle-aged tennis fans have had the comforting certainty of King Roger plying his trade on the world tennis circuit.  ,Unlike constitutional monarchies, though, those of the sporting world are produced by performance, not heredity. The new tennis regime is yet to take shape.,
  ,
,I only saw Roger Federer in the flesh once.  ,It was two decades ago in London’s shiny ,, and young Roger – an up-and-coming professional contracted to Nike – was playing an exhibition game with oversized tennis balls and undersized racquets. My initial cynicism was overwhelmed by the astonishing athleticism on display.  ,I thought he’d do well then, but had no idea I was witnessing the rise of the House of Roger.,Federer, we are told, may return to such spaces to play post-retirement exhibition games. The ,, dedicated to alleviating child poverty through education, could use the money.,But before the next phase of King Roger’s life there must be the , of his appearance in the O2 arena in London, this week’s global capital of farewell ceremonies.,

            I’ve had COVID and am constantly getting colds. Did COVID harm my immune system? Am I now at risk of other infectious diseases?
          ","So you’ve had COVID and have now recovered. You don’t have ongoing symptoms and luckily, you don’t seem to have developed ,. ,But what impacts has COVID had on your overall immune system?,It’s early days yet. But growing evidence suggests there are changes to your immune system that may put you at risk of other infectious diseases.,Here’s what we know so far.,Over this past winter, many of us have had what seemed like a , of viral illness. This may have included COVID, , or infection with ,. We may have recovered from one infection, only to get another.,Then there is the re-emergence of infectious diseases globally such as , or ,.,Could these all be connected? Does COVID somehow weaken the immune system to make us more prone to other infectious diseases?,There are , for infectious diseases to emerge in new locations, after many decades, or in new populations. So we cannot jump to the conclusion COVID infections have given rise to these and other viral infections.,But evidence is building of the negative impact of COVID on a healthy  , immune system, several weeks after symptoms have subsided.,
  ,
,There are three possible outcomes after a viral infection:,1) your immune system clears the infection and you recover (for instance, with , which causes the common cold),2) your immune system fights the virus into “latency” and you recover with a virus dormant in our bodies (for instance, ,, which causes chickenpox) ,3) your immune system fights, and despite best efforts the virus remains “chronic”, replicating at very low levels (this can occur for ,).,Ideally we all want option 1, to clear the virus. In fact, most of us ,, the virus that causes COVID. That’s through a complex process, using many different parts of our immune system.,But international evidence suggests changes to our immune cells after SARS-CoV-2 infection may have other impacts. It may affect our ability to fight other viruses, as well as other pathogens, such as bacteria or fungi. ,
  ,
,An , has found SARS-CoV-2 alters the balance of immune cells up to 24 weeks after clearing the infection. ,There were changes to the relative numbers and types of immune cells between people who had recovered from COVID compared with healthy people who had not been infected.,This included changes to cells of the , (which provides a non-specific immune response) and the , (a specific immune response, targeting a recognised foreign invader)., focused specifically on , – the immune cells that are often considered the body’s “first line of defence”.,Researchers found fewer of these cells circulating after people recovered from COVID. The ones that remained were less able to activate white blood cells known as ,, a critical step in activating anti-viral immunity.,Other studies have found different impacts on T-cells, and other types of white blood cells known as , (cells involved in producing antibodies).,After SARS-CoV-2 infection, one study , many of these cells had been activated and “exhausted”. This suggests the cells are dysfunctional, and might not be able to adequately fight a subsequent infection. In other words, sustained activation of these immune cells after a SARS-CoV-2 infection may have an impact on other inflammatory diseases., found people who had recovered from COVID have changes in different types of B-cells. This included changes in the cells’ metabolism, which may impact how these cells function. Given B-cells are critical for producing antibodies, we’re not quite sure of the precise implications.,Could this influence how our bodies produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 should we encounter it again? Or could this impact our ability to produce antibodies against pathogens more broadly – against other viruses, bacteria or fungi? The study did not say.,
  ,
,One of the main concerns is whether such changes may impact how the immune system responds to other infections, or whether these changes 
might worsen or cause other chronic conditions. ,So more work needs to be done to understand the long-term impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on a person’s immune system.,For instance, we still don’t know how long these changes to the immune system last, and if the immune system recovers. We also don’t know if SARS-CoV-2 triggers other chronic illnesses, such as , (myalgic encephalomyelitis). Research into this is ongoing.,What we do know is that having a healthy immune system and being vaccinated (when a vaccine has been developed) is critically important to have the best chance of fighting any infection.","Published: September 19, 2022 6.15am AEST",https://theconversation.com/ive-had-covid-and-am-constantly-getting-colds-did-covid-harm-my-immune-system-am-i-now-at-risk-of-other-infectious-diseases-188899,"<li class=""topic-list-item"">

            What do we owe future generations? And what can we do to make their world a better place?
          ","Your great grandchildren , in today’s society. As Oxford philosopher William MacAskill says:,But the things we do now influence them: for better or worse. We make laws that govern them, build infrastructure for them and take out loans for them to pay back. So what happens when we consider future generations while we make decisions today?,This is the key question in ,. It argues for what MacAskill calls longtermism: “the idea that positively influencing the longterm future is a key moral priority of our time.” He describes it as an extension of civil rights and women’s suffrage; as humanity marches on, we strive to consider a wider circle of people when making decisions about how to structure our societies.,MacAskill makes a compelling case that we should consider how to ensure a good future not only for our children’s children, but also the children of , children. In short, MacAskill argues that “future people count, there could be a lot of them, and we can make their lives go better.”,
  ,
,It’s hard to feel for future people. We are bad enough at feeling for our future selves. As , puts it: “That’s a problem for future Homer. Man, I don’t envy that guy.”,We all know we , protect our health for our own future. In a similar vein, MacAskill argues that we all “know” future people count.,Future people count, and MacAskill counts those people. The sheer number of future people might make their wellbeing a key moral priority. According to MacAskill and others, ,: much, much more than the 8 billion alive today.,While it’s hard to feel the gravitas, our actions may affect a dizzying number of people. Even if we last just 1 million years, as long as the average mammal – and even if the global population fell to 1 billion people – then there would be 9.1 trillion people in the future.,We might struggle to care, because these numbers can be hard to ,. Our emotions don’t track well against large numbers. If I said a nuclear war would kill 500 million people, you might see that as a “huge problem”. If I instead said that the number is ,, it still feels like a “huge problem”. It does not emotionally , 10 times worse. If we risk the trillions of people who could live in the future, that could be 1,000 times worse – but it doesn’t , 1,000 times worse.,MacAskill does not argue we should give those people 1,000 times more concern than people alive today. Likewise, MacAskill does not say we should morally weight a person living a million years from now exactly the same as someone alive 10 or 100 years from now. Those distinctions won’t change what we can feasibly achieve now, given how hard change can be. ,Instead, he shows if we care about future people at all, even those 100 years hence, we should simply be doing ,. Fortunately, there are concrete things humanity can do.,
  ,
,Another reason we , by big problems is that they feel insurmountable. This is a particular concern with future generations. Does anything I do make a difference, or is it a drop in the bucket? How do we know what to do when the ,?,Even present-day problems can feel hard to tackle. At least for those problems we can get fast, reliable feedback on progress. Even with that advantage, we struggle. For the second year in a row, we , toward our sustainable development goals, like reducing war, poverty, and increasing growth. Globally, , die before the age of five. COVID-19 has killed about ,. Can we – and should we – justify focusing on future generations when we face these problems now?,MacAskill argues we can. Because the number of people is so large, he also argues we should. He identifies some areas where we could do things that protect the future while also helping people who are alive now. Many solutions are win-win.,For example, the current pandemic has shown that unforeseen events can have a devastating effect. Yet, despite the recent pandemic, many governments have done little to set up more robust systems that could , MacAskill outlines ways in which those future pandemics could be worse.,Most worrying are the threats from engineered pathogens, which ,He gives examples, like militaries and terrorist groups, that have tried to engineer pathogens in the past.,The risk of an engineered , wiping us all out in the next 100 years is between 0.1% and 3%, according to estimates laid out in the book. ,That might sound low, but MacAskill argues we would not step on a plane if you were told “it ‘only’ had a one-in-a-thousand chance of crashing and killing everyone on board”. These threaten not only future generations, but people reading this – and everyone they know.,MacAskill outlines ways in which we might be able to prevent engineered pandemics, like researching better personal protective equipment, cheaper and faster diagnostics, better infrastructure, or better governance of synthetic biology. Doing so would help save the lives of people alive today, reduce the risk of technological stagnation and protect humanity’s future. ,The same win-wins might apply to ,, safe development of ,, reducing risks from ,, and other threats to humanity.,
  ,
,Some “longtermist” issues, like climate change, are already firmly in the public consciousness. As a result, some may find MacAskill’s book “common sense”. Others may find the speculation about the far future pretty wild (like , of the longterm future).,MacAskill strikes an accessible balance between anchoring the arguments to concrete examples, while making modest extrapolations into the future. He helps us see how “common sense” principles can lead to novel or neglected conclusions. ,For example, if there is any moral weight on future people, then many common societal goals (like faster economic growth) are vastly less important than reducing risks of extinction (like nuclear non-proliferation). It makes humanity look like an “imprudent teenager”, with many years ahead, but more power than wisdom:,Our biases toward present, local problems are strong, so connecting emotionally with the ideas can be hard. But MacAskill makes a compelling case for longtermism through clear stories and good metaphors. He answers many questions I had about safeguarding the future. Will the future be good or bad? Would it really matter if humanity ended? And, importantly, is there anything I can actually do?,The short answer is yes, there is. Things you might already do help, like minimising your carbon footprint – but MacAskill argues “other things you can do are radically more impactful”. For example, , would address climate change, but , to the world’s most effective climate charities might be far more effective. ,MacAskill points to a range of resources – many of which he founded – that guide people in these areas. For those who might have flexibility in their career, MacAskill founded ,, which helps people find impactful, satisfying careers. For those trying to donate more impactfully, he founded , And, for spreading good ideas, he started a social movement called ,.,Longtermism is one of those good ideas. It helps us better place our present in humanity’s bigger story. It’s humbling and inspiring to see the role we can play in protecting the future. We can enjoy life now and safeguard the future for our great grandchildren. MasAskill clearly shows that we owe it to them.","Published: September 19, 2022 6.15am AEST",https://theconversation.com/what-do-we-owe-future-generations-and-what-can-we-do-to-make-their-world-a-better-place-189591,"<li class=""topic-list-item"">

            What do Britain’s tears for Queen Elizabeth mean?
          ","The BBC , that “some of the first mourners to see Queen Elizabeth II lying in state in Westminster Hall have come away in tears, describing the sight of the cloaked coffin as overwhelming”. What is really going on here?,Vast numbers of people do not simply grieve on command. Britain is not North Korea, where the dramatics of hysterical lamentation are switched on and off by official edict. But neither has the outburst of national mourning following the death of the Queen been entirely extemporaneous. Grieving crowds have had to engage with a narrative that has meaning to them, and that narrative has had to be produced, disseminated and refined over time to make it affectively resonant. ,The royal narrative has been a long time in the making and, much as many commentators have pointed out that the story of Queen Elizabeth II has defined our age, we might also note that our age of sophisticated public relations and political mood management has shaped it. As the cultural historian Thomas Dixon showed in his wonderful ,, when people weep together in moments of collective national feeling “a complex, shared, unconscious, intellectual narrative is running down your cheeks”.,What is it then that people have been crying about in the aftermath of the Queen’s death? Or, if not actually weeping, experiencing quiet feelings of loss and sadness?,In her , to the late monarch in the House of Commons, the new prime minister stated that the Queen was “the rock on which modern Britain was built … The United Kingdom is the great country it is today because of her.” ,Such massive historical claims deny and defy the complexities of social development. It may be reasonable to state that the late Queen re-invented her role in line with forces of modernity that were going on around her, but even the most ardent monarchist would not suggest that she was personally responsible for bringing them about. Such exaggeration only serves to make the bereaved seem deluded.,And there are plenty of commentators willing to depict those who visibly grieve at moments like this as emotional saps. Former prime minister Boris Johnson characterised the expression of public grief at the time of Princess Diana’s death as “hysteria” and ,. ,Apart from its profound condescension towards the people involved, such attempts to pathologise public emotions fail to acknowledge the extent to which membership of a society is not simply a matter of utilitarian interest fulfilment but attachment, shared sentiment and active desire. It is about notions of a stable world; the nurturance and fragility of valued relationships; the delicate interflows between private experience and public existence; the interplay between media representation and personal projection.,We might refer to surges of amorphous, intangible, inarticulable public feeling as mood. I have written , that “moods force us to encounter the sensorial forms through which historical forces become available to experience”. They are not like rational opinions whereby causes, effects and courses of action are pinpointed, but allude to our sense of who we are and why we care about things. Moods are suggestive. They open us up to possibilities of feeling.,People queuing to see the Queen’s body have told stories to reporters about how this moment of reflection opened up emotional space for them to release buried feelings about losses in their own lives. Rather than thinking of the current display of public passions as “hysteria” or “contagion”, perhaps we should think of it as a moment in which people pose the crucial questions: “What opportunities are available to me for relating to this situation on my own terms? What might be involved in acting upon these feelings that I am barely registering at the moment?”,Surely enough, people’s feelings are going to be put to a tough test in the days to come, as the gap between incomes and the cost of living widens, the insecurities of European war disrupt their lives, and the health services they have always depended upon bear unprecedented strains.,Amid such turmoil, risk and impermanence, the search for reliable constants is perfectly understandable. The monarchist narrative (which to people like me is antithetical to our democratic impulses and preferred stories about the world) will appeal to some and repel others. ,More important than which narrative of social cohesion and morality we buy into is the significance of acknowledging the value of emotionally resonant shared narratives. For it is only by creating and sustaining them that we can hope to have any control over what the world means to us and we to it.","Published: September 17, 2022 1.17am AEST",https://theconversation.com/what-do-britains-tears-for-queen-elizabeth-mean-190784,"<li class=""topic-list-item"">

            Queen Elizabeth II: the history of royal funerals and how this one will be different
          ","Great royal events in the United Kingdom are often a mix of old and new, and the commemoration and funeral of Queen Elizabeth II will be no exception. While there will be several strikingly new features, the seemingly traditional elements are not as old as they may appear. While some newer elements are revivals from the past. ,The , is one of innovation and tradition to preserve the monarchy’s popularity and relevance. Public service and the monarch’s ability to represent the whole nation have become the main themes.,The organisation of public mourning for Elizabeth II, which began with her death on September 8 and will end after her funeral on September 19, is a huge national undertaking. However, the funerals of sovereigns have not always been public spectacles.,Since the 18th century, all British monarchs were , and for a long period, funeral ceremonies took place within Windsor Castle. ,Changes began with the death of Queen Victoria in 1901. In part, this was in recognition of her long reign of 63 years. But it was also a culmination of efforts, noticeable at her jubilees in 1887 and 1897, to make the monarchy more public. This was to encourage greater popular attachment , in a society which was becoming more democratic – and potentially more critical of an ancient and privileged institution. ,The day of Queen Victoria’s funeral was proclaimed a day of national mourning, during which all work ceased. This was done in the expectation that many people would attend memorial church services – which then was the chief means to express public grief and respect. ,For the first time after a monarch’s death, the Church of England issued special commemorative services for use in all its local places of worship, and the leaders of most other religious communities in the United Kingdom also encouraged the organisation of local memorial services. ,Everywhere, church and chapel services were crowded. That Queen Victoria died at her home on the Isle of Wight created the opportunity for further mass demonstrations of grief, as her coffin, on its route to Windsor, was carried in a long and slow procession across London, through streets ,. Public processions have remained central to later funerals of monarchs, though now focused around Westminster.,Following the deaths of Victoria’s successors, further measures were taken to involve the public. ,When Edward VII died in London in 1910, a public lying in state at Westminster Hall was introduced. His son, George V, insisted that access should be “democratic” and nearly , paid their respects by filing past the coffin. He also asked that all local memorial services on the day of the funeral begin at the same time as the service at Windsor, to create simultaneous national participation in the prayers of commemoration. ,For George V’s own funeral in 1936, the day of mourning was replaced by a national two-minute silence to avoid loss of work during a time of economic depression. The silence also linked the king’s death with the annual mass ritual of remembrance of the dead of the first world war. ,His , was attended by over 750,000 people. Radio broadcasts created a vast audience for the public ceremonies, in a new form of mass participation. ,For the commemoration in 1952 of King George VI, who had achieved great public prominence during the second world war, two further additions were made. ,After the funeral at Windsor, a special remembrance service was held at St Paul’s Cathedral, attended by members of the government, parliament and other national leaders. The memorial services and funeral procession in London became the first royal events to be broadcast by television as well as radio.,Many facets of royal commemorations since 1901 remain integral to the arrangements in 2022 but there are new elements. ,Some of these features result from advances in television and electronic media, others are a tribute to an even longer reign than Queen Victoria’s. ,The state of the union of the United Kingdom has also influenced the plans that the civil service and Buckingham Palace have maintained and regularly revised since the 1930s for “the demise of the Crown” – known more recently under the code name “,”.,The union has weakened since 1952, with the development of independence parties and devolved administrations. The plans include events to help sustain the monarchy’s position in the different parts of the union during the delicate transition between sovereigns. As such, the new king and queen consort will attend “national” memorial services in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. ,The unexpected element was the Queen’s death in Scotland, which has enabled the organisation of a well-publicised and televised journey through numerous communities. It has also led to a procession and an additional public lying-at-rest of the coffin in Edinburgh to supplement the memorial service in ,.,Another factor that has influenced new additions is the public expectation that royalty should be more accessible and visible, which they ,. ,The transition from Elizabeth II to Charles III seemed likely to be delicate because of recurrent criticisms of the royal family, including the new king. Recent troubles relate to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and the Duke of York, but deeper concerns date from the breakdown of the King’s first marriage, the popularity of Diana and the outpourings of grief after her death in 1997. ,Consequently, additional opportunities have been created for national leaders and the public to emphasise their respect for the monarchy. The ,, which had been common until 1760, was probably long planned. ,The Abbey can accommodate a larger congregation than St George’s Chapel Windsor and its central location allows more people to watch the procession – as was witnessed at Diana’s funeral and the funeral of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother in 2002.,Moving the , at St Paul’s Cathedral from after the monarch’s funeral to the day after the Queen’s death has provided a sharper focus for the start of national mourning. The new ,, the first , and the unusually early televised message of the king’s receipt of the condolences and , were all designed to ease the change of sovereign in the public consciousness.,There will now be a , on the Sunday evening before the funeral, as well as a two-minute silence on the funeral day itself. A revival of the national day of mourning will also increase public involvement, allowing huge audiences to watch the televised funeral ceremonies and bringing massive crowds to the procession route and screening points in London.,Both the great popular admiration for the late Queen and the successful presentation of her commemoration can be measured by the extent to which members of the public are prepared to express their respect. Huge numbers of people are expected to ,, perhaps even overnight, to attend her lying-in-state for five days in Westminster Hall – just as there were , for the lying-at-rest in St Giles’ Cathedral. On the day of the funeral, even greater numbers are predicted to travel to London to witness the processions and ceremonies in and around Westminster Abbey to say goodbye.","Published: September 17, 2022 1.05am AEST",https://theconversation.com/queen-elizabeth-ii-the-history-of-royal-funerals-and-how-this-one-will-be-different-190499,"<li class=""topic-list-item"">

            Silence of the poets – has an ancient tradition of commemorative verse died with the Queen?
          ","Not so long ago, the death of a monarch would have been a cue for outpourings of elegies and poetic commemorations. One might have thought the end of the second Elizabethan era would prompt something similar – but apparently not.,So far, the death of Queen Elizabeth II has had only a muted response from our poets, both in the United Kingdom and here in Aotearoa New Zealand. Does this reflect shifting priorities in the national imagination? Are we witnessing the demise of poetry on public occasions?,We need only look back at the death in 1936 of the queen’s grandfather, George V, for comparison. , and , were among the poets who marked the occasion. Betjeman was England’s poet laureate from 1972 until his death in 1984, and also wrote on the , and the ,.,Betjeman stood in a long line of British poet laureates stretching back unbroken to John Dryden in 1668, and to poets such as Geoffrey Chaucer before that. But the culture of poetry responding to monarchs’ deaths has flourished outside the official post, too.,The unexpected death in 1612 of the 18-year-old Prince Henry, son and heir to James VI and I, prompted an ,. , wrote an elegy, as did George Herbert, John Webster and Sir Walter Raleigh.,Particularly voluminous was the the flood of poetry that met the execution of King Charles I at the height of the English Civil Wars in 1649. His , on a scaffold erected outside Whitehall Palace made him a martyr to his loyal followers. ,Literary historian Nigel Smith has described the way elegy became a royalist genre, as the death of the king “sucked all elegiac energy into its own subject”.,And there are close connections nearby to these elegies on King Charles I. Melbourne’s State Library Victoria holds the , of over 5,000 early modern English books, among which poems, pamphlets and other , feature prominently.,Poetic treasures in the collection include a copy of Monumentum Regale: Or a Tombe, Erected for that Incomparable and Glorious Monarch, Charles the First, a volume of elegies and poetic “sighs” and “groans” published three months after the king’s execution. Royalist poets grapple with how they can possibly commemorate an “incomparable” king. The Earl of Montrose declares he has written his poem with “blood”, “wounds” and the point of his sword.,
  ,
,In Aotearoa New Zealand, the Alexander Turnbull Library is famous for its collection of works by a poet from the other side of the 17th-century political divide, John Milton. , (1868–1918) had a personal interest in Milton, an ardent republican. Even Turnbull’s collection, however, contains a notable number of volumes celebrating Charles I, including multiple editions of Eikon Basilike (The King’s Book), which represented Charles I as a Christ-like martyr.,This vast body of public poetry about previous monarchs is in sharp contrast to the response to Queen Elizabeth II’s death. Even in the United Kingdom, the current poet laureate, Simon Armitage, seems to have struggled. The form of his poem “Floral Tribute”, an acrostic on the name “,”, seems archaic at best and banal at worst.,New Zealand’s poet laurate, Chris Tse, inaugurated only a few weeks ago, has been notably silent. When I asked him why, he said writing a poem for the queen “would be a backwards step in terms of where I want the role to go”.,Tse’s reticence perhaps echoes the complicated thoughts of Selina Tusitala Marsh, a recent former laureate, on , “Unity” for the queen in 2016. For Marsh, the British Crown’s colonial legacy (as she put it, “Her peeps also colonised my peeps”) made writing and performing the poem a complex commission to accept.,
  ,
,As laureate, Marsh preferred to write poems on occasions such as ,. But the fact New Zealand even has a , in 2022 suggests there is still an appetite for public poetry, even if the days of poems on the death of a queen are numbered.,The modern monarchy itself, of course, provides rich material for poetry of a less commemorative kind. Bill Manhire, New Zealand’s inaugural laureate, speculated on Twitter that we are awaiting an acrostic on “Andrew”. And the most remarkable poem of the morning we awoke to news of the queen’s death was essa may ranapiri’s “,”.,Immediate and visceral, it’s an unabashed anti-colonialist spit in the face of monarchy. Some will find it shocking, others will gasp with appreciation. But even those taken aback by its frank approach and timing may share the sense of distance it captures, in its formal displacement of the news from afar by scrambled eggs, spring sunlight and the joy of quotidian love as a new day begins.,Public poetry isn’t dead. But our poets’ responses to the death of the queen – the silent, the awkward, the confrontational – tell us much, as ever, about the societies we live in.","Published: September 19, 2022 12.01pm AEST",https://theconversation.com/silence-of-the-poets-has-an-ancient-tradition-of-commemorative-verse-died-with-the-queen-190834,"<li class=""topic-list-item"">
